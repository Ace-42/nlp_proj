1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It might be the end of our friendship, Pamela.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Come on.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It's...

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hey!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hey! How's it going, mate?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's with this... the get-up?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I don't understand the reference.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I just thought maybe you'd like to film more at home, you know?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
It's... I mean, it's crazy, because I...

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I don't even know how you knew that I went to jail.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I barely ever bring it up.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's up looking at?

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Holy moly!

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I was jailburdened!

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I was jailburdened on it.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I was...

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I was jailburdened!

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, damn, I got caught. Look at the jailburden again.

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
No, in Australia, we wear green in prison instead of orange.

21
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Is that why you're in green?

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Is this green?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Yeah.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I call it more teal, I don't know.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Anyway, it's a wee thousand jo...

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We'd like to go first.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, it says a paper-ocky?

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Ah, sure, we can go.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It says it is paper-ock.

30
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It says it is paper-ock.

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It says it is paper-ock.

32
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why do you do it quietly?

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's so weird.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It says it is paper-ock.

35
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Get it together!

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Why are you making that face?

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You're like... not even one.

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What face?

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, my gosh.

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Just... you start.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't give up with this, it says paper-ock.

42
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why are you gated so rude?

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why?

44
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Because they're fucking ourselves.

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, that's my best joke.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
All right.

47
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ah, this is not funny.

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm not going to do it.

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm not going to do it.

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not going to do it.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm not going to do it.

52
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm not going to do it.

53
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not going to do it.

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This is not funny.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This is not going to go well.

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What kind of jokes make you laugh?

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Because I'm going to need your guidance.

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
If I'm going to get you to laugh at you, please.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Good to be here.

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go ahead.

61
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why was the parrot in prison?

62
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, we've got jail jokes.

63
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
All right.

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why was the parrot in prison? Tell me.

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Because it was a jailbird.

66
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You know, you're a type.

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I went to a paraplegic strip club the other day.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The place was crawling with pussy.

69
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No.

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No.

71
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
For...

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You're tough, Abbs.

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You're a role model.

74
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You're tough.

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
If they don't crack it, they're my best stuff.

76
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who never minds being interrupted in the middle of a sentence?

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
A convict.

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've just got prison jokes.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm really sorry.

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If this is triggering, you can let me know.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, that's all right.

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I've got mostly jokes about prostitutes.

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So we really went for each other's jugular?

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Did you hear about the rapper who only battled when she was on it?

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No.

87
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Did you hear about the rapper that only battled when she was on her period?

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
No.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
They said she had a mean flow.

90
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I like that one.

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I knew I was going to lose this, but I didn't think it would be this comprehensive.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Comprehensive?

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It's 3-0, why is it a moment?

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Why is a white guy in prison scarier than a black guy in prison?

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Tell me.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because the white guy actually did it?

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, you did actually deal drugs in there?

100
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I did, but they were the good drugs.

101
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
And if anyone needs any out there, I'm not allowed to sell them for another year.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Did they actually?

103
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm just going to wait.

104
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The bottom of the Yamad merch mailing list, you'll see it.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'll be extra option.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Take that box.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Have you heard of a reverse exorcism?

108
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's when the devil tells the priest to get out of the child.

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Oh.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Oh.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Oh.

113
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh.

114
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh.

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, my gosh.

118
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh, fuck.

119
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Well, here we are.

120
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Here we are.

121
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Cheers.

122
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What's the difference between a Jula and a prison guard?

123
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A Jula?

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Mm-hmm.

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,000
One watches cells and one sells watches.

126
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I've got one of those kind of jokes.

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Go on then.

128
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What's the difference between an epileptic oyster fisherman?

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
An epileptic oyster fisherman, yeah.

130
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And a prostitute with diarrhea.

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,000
One sharks between here and onefish ducks between here.

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fuck that shit!

133
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
One sharks between here and onefish between here.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's three sharks.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mhm.

136
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Uh.

137
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
One sharks between here and fish her with two.

138
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah, see if you got it!

139
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah!

140
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
LAUGHTER

141
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, no!

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
How's that going?

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
LAUGHTER

144
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
This is the new...

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yeah, Mad, Drinking Shorate...

146
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Shocklasses.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Cheers.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do you know what Mrs. Doubtfire served time in prison for?

149
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No?

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Male fraud.

151
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I thought you were going to do like a robbing movie.

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Where he was in prison.

153
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
In person, actually.

154
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hello!

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Coming in.

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well, like...

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What do you call getting gonorrhea from a handicapped person?

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What?

159
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Slow clap.

160
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You know it's bad if Ben makes a...

161
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, no, sir.

162
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's so bad.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Have you ever slept with a disabled person?

164
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ah, death go.

165
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Yeah.

166
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How could you tell...

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How could I tell you she was death?

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No, that's not what I was going to say.

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Because she was lip-raining.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Your lips.

171
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are lip-liquid.

172
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You know what I asked, that's on me.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You had sex in my mate's kitchen and...

174
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
She fucked off the dive-dark.

175
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Sell us the store.

176
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
She's death, she didn't know how loud she was being.

177
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Are you sure she was like...

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It was from pleasure and not like...

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
How could you tell her she was screaming?

180
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, no.

181
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
That was not an invitation to do an impersonation.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is it your joke?

183
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It is, it is, yeah.

184
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
A man escaped from prison.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What are his initials?

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
S-K-P.

187
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Mm-hmm.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's clever.

189
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I tell you know it's a good joke when no one laughs,

190
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you never goes, that's fun.

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I like that.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why did Michael Jackson have an allergic reaction?

193
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Did the impression first?

194
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Do you know why he had an allergic reaction?

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I won't, I won't hear it until you did the impression.

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He got stung by a bee.

197
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Bee.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why is that just a blind hand?

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
She's asking for it.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll be working on my 10th, thanks for noticing.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Thank you.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
What are you doing?

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I wanted to say, if you just need to be resting and be bee on your belly.

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, be good, it's so good.

205
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Yeah.

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Are you getting it?

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's so hot in here.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What do you got?

210
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What do you call a drug dealer that shows up on time?

211
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Great and...

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I can't.

213
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can't.

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A cop?

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah.

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Well that's insulting to the drug dealing community I think.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What's very punctual?

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Where are you?

219
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Very punctual.

220
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Service with a smile, punctual.

221
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Service with a smile.

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Good drugs, good value, great customer service.

223
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's how you get ahead.

224
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you doing an odd breed right now?

225
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is this?

226
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
And that's what Andrew Hamilton's drug dealing service.

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Good a mushrooming dog coke.

228
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you call a Serbian prostitute?

229
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What?

230
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Slumber down my cocky bitch.

231
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You heard of Slumber.

232
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Slumber.

233
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Have I heard of what?

234
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Slumber down my cocky bitch.

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That's not what you said.

236
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You changed the name halfway through the joke.

237
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
No, that's his real name.

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He's real name, so it's a male prostitute.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No, the old leader of Serbia was Slumber down my cocky bitch.

240
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And the Serbian prostitute is Slumber down my cocky bitch.

241
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Pretty good.

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
What's the difference between an escaped prisoner and an orphan?

243
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Only one is wanted.

244
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I think we've had a few of those kind of wanted orphan jokes before.

245
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Oh yeah.

246
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
It's a real great subject for us all, considering none of us are orphans.

247
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I know it's just hard.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What's the best part about having a hookah dog?

249
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Don't definitely have to take a shot.

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sorry, I was taking you shot for the laughing.

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What's the best part about having a hookah dog on you?

252
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What?

253
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
The second hour is free.

254
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
You were shaking the table so hard that you could spill it.

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's a real...

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
South of Lanzadil.

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You like that one?

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Yeah, nice one.

259
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Why did my dad go to prison?

260
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Your dad went to prison?

261
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why?

262
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Beats me.

263
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That's pretty good.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
He always asks about the bruises on me and I just felt like he deserved an explanation.

265
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Why are non-alcoholic beers like going down on your sister?

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Why?

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Because they make tastes the same, but it doesn't make it right.

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Do you have a sister?

269
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Three.

270
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do they all taste the same?

271
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
None of your business.

272
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Shouldn't be yours, mate.

273
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We're very close in Hamilton family.

274
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
How do you maintain your professional network in prison?

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Via lockdown.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, it's like LinkedIn.

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Lockdown.

278
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's a lot of puns based on prison.

279
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Where...clever, where'd play?

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Yeah, I'd play with them.

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
What are you called children born in a whole house?

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
In a whole house or a whole house?

283
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
A whole house.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Gotcha.

285
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Brothel sprouts.

286
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's good.

287
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It is good.

288
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, I go in.

289
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
These are shit.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's the thing.

291
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm really going to throw that thing.

292
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm really going to throw that thing.

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thank you, Shar.

294
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
No, I got it and got something.

295
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Thank you, Shar, though, because that was a love apparently.

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
That was funny.

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What's another name for coming inside a woman?

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What?

299
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You look worried to say the answer in this.

300
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It might be the end of our friendship, haven't we?

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I want to hear the joke again.

302
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What's the joke again?

303
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I've forgotten you've been laughing for so fucking long.

304
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What's the name for coming inside a woman?

305
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm a terrible woman.

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Yeah.

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm a terrible woman.

308
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
What?

309
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Loading the dishwasher.

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Loading the dishwasher.

311
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That's not funny.

312
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
We run that.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
That's terrible.

314
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What's the difference between Disney and porn?

315
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh, what is it?

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Disney teaches you to hate your stepmother.

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I love stepmother porn.

318
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I cannot talk.

319
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Clearly, it's an awesome Disney movie.

320
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
It's going up.

321
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Have you heard that hookers don't fart?

322
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No.

323
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
They do little prostitutes.

324
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You remember, like, two videos ago when you were like,

325
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
they're called sex workers.

326
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This whole thing has been hookers and prostitutes.

327
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I thought...

328
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Just saying.

329
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I thought it'd be funny.

330
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Respect the business, you know?

331
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oh, I do respect the beers.

332
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What did you just say?

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Follow me on Only Fans.

334
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'll shout about it.

335
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are you done?

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you tapping out?

337
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No. You got more?

338
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yeah, I got more.

339
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I've got...

340
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I've got so many more.

341
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I've been full paid for them.

342
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Brood.

343
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Brood.

344
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Go on, on, on.

345
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Thanks.

346
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
One day, yo. Oh, no, you did win one.

347
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I beat Matt once.

348
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Go off.

349
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Hop off, King.
