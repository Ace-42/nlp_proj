1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
Um, 40 mouth disease.

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,040
Yeah.

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,080
More like 40 mouth, yes please.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,040
LAUGHTER

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
LAUGHTER

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,080
I don't know what I'm doing.

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:22,120
Are we hugging? Are we hugging?

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,320
You're lying, you're already?

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,800
Yeah.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,719
Yeah. Yeah.

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,960
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,480
Oh my god, how are you feeling?

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,160
I am feeling nervous.

14
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,240
I'm feeling nervous.

15
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,000
You feeling nervous?

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,719
I am.

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,200
I should actually hurt you feeling.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,160
Yeah, that's how communication kind of goes.

19
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,160
LAUGHTER

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,799
But yes, no, I'm nervous too.

21
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:43,799
That's good.

22
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:44,799
That's going to be great. All right, we...

23
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,799
That's good.

24
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:46,799
In his AI.

25
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:48,600
Oh, yeah, there you are.

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm also holding the camera at the same time.

27
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
LAUGHTER

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,880
Um, can you show me your little sister's pepper off?

29
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Let's show her sister's pepper off.

30
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
OK, ready? Yeah.

31
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
OK.

32
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,240
This is paper off.

33
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,240
This is paper off.

34
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,240
Oh.

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,439
Let's do it this chemistry.

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,439
Seems like Ian's going to be the one that Foxpaten.

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,439
LAUGHTER

38
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,439
LAUGHTER

39
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,439
That's the nicest thing someone ever said to me.

40
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:17,240
LAUGHTER

41
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,040
OK, so you want, do you want to go...

42
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,040
I'll go first. OK.

43
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,240
Yeah. Like that.

44
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,240
So I've been writing dad jokes.

45
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,240
I've been writing dad jokes.

46
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,000
I wrote a lot of dad jokes that actually wrote a book.

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, it's a...

48
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,840
It's a thousand and one dad jokes by Ian Luther.

49
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,840
Do you want to have a look through it?

50
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,840
That's OK.

51
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
LAUGHTER

52
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Just a stud jokes.

53
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
LAUGHTER

54
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,840
That's fine.

55
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,840
Like, you've got to go.

56
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,840
Oh!

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,840
This is the title of this work, though.

58
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,840
This guy came in cross, man.

59
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,840
This is true.

60
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,840
Now, it's fully...

61
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,359
Yeah, it's dead set.

62
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,359
Oh, what?

63
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,359
Heaps, if you guys don't have it.

64
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,359
That's the one I'm here.

65
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,359
Get me in the steps.

66
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,359
Yeah, tough, yeah.

67
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,359
I laughed as well, so I'm going to drink.

68
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:06,359
The craziest thing is, that's the first book,

69
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,360
Paten's Ever Red.

70
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,360
I did read the hungry caterpillar once.

71
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,360
OK?

72
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
LAUGHTER

73
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,360
Oh, jeez.

74
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,360
She is sorry.

75
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,360
Mmm.

76
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Oh, are you having a drink?

77
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,360
Oh, my god, that's...

78
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,360
What do you call a rooster that's not good at maths?

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,360
A disappointment?

80
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
A math and a chicken.

81
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Does that count as a laugh?

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Oh.

83
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,360
You're like, yeah, fuck that.

84
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,360
It's just relieving his childhood.

85
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,360
I am.

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
A disappointment.

87
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,360
You're laughing?

88
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Yeah, I've got a cool chicken a lot.

89
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Oh.

90
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Does that count as...

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,360
LAUGHTER

92
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,360
You're not a chicken.

93
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
I'm not. Thank you.

94
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,360
You are.

95
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,360
That's the second nicest thing someone said to me today.

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
Of course I go.

97
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
Oh, I'm really going to keep this.

98
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,360
This is exactly what I call that.

99
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
It's an easy read.

100
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,360
LAUGHTER

101
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
You're a vlogger.

102
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
LAUGHTER

103
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,360
So I was watching these two minds have sex the other day.

104
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Yeah, they were doing unspeakable things to each other.

105
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
LAUGHTER

106
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
That was good.

107
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,360
I like that.

108
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,360
Thank you.

109
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,360
I love her.

110
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,360
This is about to be the most awesome episode.

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,360
Yeah.

112
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
It's like I'm bored.

113
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,360
He'd say the N word.

114
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
LAUGHTER

115
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Never kill you.

116
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,360
LAUGHTER

117
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Do I have your permission?

118
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,360
I can't do this.

119
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Your permission.

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,360
I'll pay you a visit.

121
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
I was going to pay you really.

122
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Can we just beep and pretend I said that.

123
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Relaxing.

124
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Relaxing.

125
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
Ah!

126
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,360
Now I can't read my phone.

127
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
You can pick it up.

128
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360
Letting you do it's things.

129
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
These go what?

130
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
These.

131
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Ah.

132
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
So you said a disease.

133
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,360
I was like, oh.

134
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
I got that.

135
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
What do you get when you see a pair of heribals?

136
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
What?

137
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,360
And if you never want to see that reaction again,

138
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,360
let me introduce you to the man-scaped groin and go bundle.

139
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
Perfect for your little guy.

140
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,360
And no, I'm not talking about staff.

141
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm talking about down there.

142
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
The bundle comes with the lawnmower 5.0 Ultra,

143
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
which is perfect for when you want a trim

144
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,360
without having to worry about nicks or cuts.

145
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,360
You're telling me I don't have to worry about nicks or cuts?

146
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
Mm-hmm.

147
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,360
And the bundle also comes with the handyman face shaver,

148
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
which get this is waterproof.

149
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,360
So clean up is a breeze.

150
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,360
And how cool is this magnetic blade cover?

151
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
It's so compact.

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
You can just throw it in your bag,

153
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,360
hit the road and use it whenever you need.

154
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,360
But wait, there's more.

155
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
With three different comb options,

156
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,360
one fixed length and two adjustable,

157
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
you have complete control over your hair length.

158
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,360
And did I mention it's wireless?

159
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,360
That means this wise.

160
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
None at all.

161
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,360

173
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,360
What's the difference between

174
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
yoghurt and Americans?

175
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,360
What?

176
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,360
Yogurt grows a culture if you leave it alone for 200 years.

177
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh!

178
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,360
I'm going to buzz twice as sure as I'm on.

179
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I'm going to buzz twice as sure as I'm on.

180
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
I'm going to buzz twice as sure as I'm on.

181
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,360
I'm going to buzz twice as sure as I'm on.

182
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
Have you heard the phrase Jesus take the will?

183
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah.

184
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,360
So I think only Christians can use

185
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
their really ugly God to say that.

186
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Because if you say Muhammad take the will,

187
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
you're just talking to your Uber driver?

188
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
No!

189
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
Five stars with a joke in there.

190
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
No!

191
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Muhammad take the will!

192
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Three stars.

193
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,360
I don't know why.

194
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
I thought it was going to turn into like a hijacked shirt.

195
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
Yeah, I love it.

196
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Mm-hmm.

197
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
Oh!

198
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Hi!

199
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Hold it in.

200
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
That was...

201
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
Yuck.

202
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,360
It turned into like a fart.

203
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,360
How do you sign a rave in Ethiopia?

204
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,360
You nail a piece of toast to the ceiling.

205
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,360
I don't know about you being...

206
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I don't know about you being...

207
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
I don't know about you being...

208
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I don't know about you being...

209
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,360
Oh my god.

210
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,360
Was that a laugh?

211
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,360
I didn't laugh at that.

212
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
Yeah.

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,360
That's the whole way I was going to laugh.

214
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
I only wish I thought of it.

215
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
Piece of toast.

216
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
Oh my god.

217
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360

218
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,360
She's got a lot of factant on today.

219
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,360
It's a very true.

220
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,360
That melanin's looking strong.

221
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
So I um...

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,360
I took a date to the fish market.

223
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Yeah, but she only sashimi as a friend.

224
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,360

I know.

228
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
If this was an orange joke off,

229
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,360
I think I would have wanted to hear it out.

230
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
You would have wanted to.

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
No, that was good, guys.

232
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,360
Um...

233
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I'm thinking of selling fragrance to introverts.

234
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I'll need that.

235
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,360

You're not going to get up there.

244
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
You're going to be a fool.

245
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
Sorry.

246
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,360

LAUGHTER

256
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,360

258

267
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
I don't get it.

277
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
I don't know why I like it.

278
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
I think I've seen where he's going.

279
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Like, that's sink.

Yeah, but I don't really get it.

OK.

287
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Should I do another one?

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Yeah, yeah.

289
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360

LAUGHTER

306
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,360
Where is he coming from?

307
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
It's an alcohol.

308
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
I feel like an Elmo right now.

309
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,360
An Elmo?

310
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Like, tickle me Elmo.

Oh, you're red, OK.

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,360
No.

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360

It's the first day.

329
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,360
It started so fucking hoarse.

330
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
Yeah.

331
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,360
OK, what's the difference between raw ray and a bucket of shit?

332
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
The bucket.

333
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360

The very slow.

337
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The slow.

338
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,360
That's not the average.

339
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
I'm canceling your only only fan subscription.

340
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Don't lose so much money.

341
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
That $3 is coming back to me.

342
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360

343
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,360

346
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Yeah.

347
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
A strip club opened near the school.

348
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Yeah.

349
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Right, and people were completely, right, completely, completely...

350
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Are you getting nervous around me?

351
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
Oh, yeah.

352
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,360
So again, so again, so again.

353
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,360
That's a job, though.

354
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
OK.

355
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
So again, we really knew we loved you.

356
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Yes.

357
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Fuck, I'm quite angry with you.

358
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
You got a team here.

359
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,360
Team, team, team.

360
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,360
All right, so a strip club opened up near the school,

361
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
and people are complaining, right?

362
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Because those kids are ruining our strip club experience.

363
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
LAUGHTER

364
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
No, it's damn kids.

365
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
The school's on the way there.

366
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,360
So the kids are in the strip club, so...

367
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,360
That's what Pat's always there.

368
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,360
LAUGHTER

369
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Always running to Pat.

370
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
What do you think we're doing again?

371
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
The Irish is...

372
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
He's got damn sexy kids.

373
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
LAUGHTER

374
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,360
What did Trump say when Joe dropped out of the presidential race?

375
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,360
What did he say?

376
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Bye, Dan!

377
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,360
LAUGHTER

378
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Just like that.

379
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Can you deal with Trump's accent?

Um...

412
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
How does a manipulator change light bulb?

413
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,360
How?

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360

They're like, I'm gonna fix that and I just really didn't...

422
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I don't know.

423

Mm-hmm.

430
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,360

I've heard that hairie.

Yeah, but...

446
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,360
What does a guy with a two-inch dick have for breakfast?

447
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,360
What do you have for breakfast, Pat?

448
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,360
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

449
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Oh yeah, I mean, Ian had toast this morning.

That's all that.

456
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
That's all that.

457
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Let's drink it up.

458
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,360
We haven't got the answer, by the way.

459

So make me do a patting question.

463
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:18,360
OK.

464
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,360

But you don't want to do that.

477
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
Yeah, that makes sense.

478
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Um...

479
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
No, I didn't mean to do that.

00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,359
No, I understood it.

489
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359

That's a funny joke.

508
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,359
I didn't write that joke. I got TSC.

00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:03,359
Yes, I did.

510
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,359
Ravagy.

511
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,359
We couldn't decide if we wanted to bury or cremate my grandpa.

512
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:11,359
So we just let him live.

Exactly.

529
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,359
It's the same to trees.

530
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,359
Oh man.
