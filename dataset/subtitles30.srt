1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
There's only one thing that beats a girl with an amazing voice.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
And that's Chris Brown.

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,599
MUSIC

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:13,599
MUSIC

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,599
MUSIC

8
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,600
MUSIC

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,600
MUSIC

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,600
MUSIC

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,600
Oh my god.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
She's so fresh.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,400
People say I can't get a white woman.

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,399
She gives the best head.

19
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,400
Sorry I was in the studio.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
And that's the intro.

22
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Is this paper rock?

23
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,400
Sure.

24
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,400
Nice to see you by the way.

25
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,400
All right, you can see is this paper rock.

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
Is this paper rock?

27
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
All right.

28
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,400
You and me.

29
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,400
I'll go first.

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,199
What do we have today?

31
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,199
Nice and easy.

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,200
Have you heard of the new Russian movie streaming service?

33
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
I have not.

34
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Nyetflix.

36
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Just straight off the bat.

37
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
I'm going to try on this one.

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm trying.

39
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
It's another one.

40
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Get away and start.

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I'm going to do it.

42
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
You got to do it.

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,200
I'm going to bet.

44
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Yeah.

45
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Did that bottle of Patron ever?

46
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Yeah, I just went for better pay-be.

48
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,200
It's much faster.

50
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
For last one.

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,200
This isn't going to go down well.

52
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,200
This isn't going to go down well.

53
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
OK.

54
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Here we go.

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Where is she going?

56
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
Give it a hug.

57
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
It's going to be a rough day.

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,200
What's the difference between Paul Walker and my grandmother?

59
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Oh, God.

60
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
What?

61
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Paul Walker made it to 100.

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Oh!

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Oh!

64
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
I don't know who.

65
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
Yeah.

66
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
All right.

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,199
That's not...

68
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,199
That's not dark.

69
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,199
I got a key one.

70
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,199
So Mary gave birth to Jesus, right?

71
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:17,199
And Jesus was the Lamb of God.

72
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,199
So technically, Mary had a little Lamb.

73
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,199
That was really good.

74
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,199
That was really good.

75
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:27,199
That was fucking gay, though.

77
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:31,199
Thank you.

78
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:33,199
Thank you.

79
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:35,199
Gay.

80
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:37,199
I think that's good up for you.

81
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,199
Yeah.

82
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,199
Yeah.

83
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,199
Oh, what's that one?

84
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,199
Oh, yeah.

85
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Oh, yeah.

86
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,199
Oh.

87
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,199
Oh.

88
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:53,199
What's that one?

89
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,199
It's like...

90
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,199
It's like, um, like, medicine.

91
00:02:57,199 --> 00:02:59,199
Oh, yeah.

92
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:01,199
It looks like a lot of love.

93
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:03,199
How do you like it?

94
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,199
Kind of cute, but...

95
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:07,199
How do you say sub-dog in Japanese?

96
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:09,199
Sub-dog?

98
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,199
Sorry, sorry.

99
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,199
Sorry, sorry.

100
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,199
Sorry.

101
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,199
I love an accent, I love it.

103
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,199
That one...

104
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:27,199
I have been that a little bit before I was like this.

105
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:29,199
Yeah, tell me the punch, though.

106
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,199
Um, can you chew awa?

107
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,199
Oh, cute.

108
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,199
Is that real?

109
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:37,199
Is that just real?

110
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:39,199
No.

111
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Oh, can you chew awa?

112
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,199
No, it's alright.

114
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,199
How was your age in accent filming?

115
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:53,199
I practiced in the mirror every night.

116
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,199
You're gonna be more black accent.

117
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,199
Go on, do it.

118
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:59,199
Go on.

119
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,199
It's so hot.

120
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,199
It's really good.

121
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,199
And Ian has reached his word quarter for the episode.

122
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,199
I got another cute Jesus one.

123
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:09,199
A cute Jesus one, and we'll be...

124
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:11,199
A cute Jesus one, and we'll be...

125
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,199
What's the difference between Jesus and a prostitute?

126
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,199
What's that?

127
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:17,199
The sound they make when you're nailing him.

128
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,199
Oh, my God.

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,199
Wow.

130
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Wow.

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,199
Oh, no.

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
Oh, no.

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
Oh, no.

135
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
He's going wild.

136
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
Oh, stop talking.

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
Thank God we're going to nail him in the couch now.

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
He's going to go crazy.

140
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,199
What spell did Harry Potter use when he worked at Planet Parenthood?

141
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
What?

142
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
He is deletus.

144
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
Beed...

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
Beedeth deletus.

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
That's good.

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
I like that.

148
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,199
Beedeth deletus.

149
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,199
I like this one.

150
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,199
Did you know that coconut water is great for hair growth?

151
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,199
OK.

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
That's why my pews have been growing like crazy.

154
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
Oh.

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
And that's why I used the Manscape Performance Package 5.0 Ultra.

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,199
And we're packing.

157
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,199
We've got the Lormo of 5.0 Ultra, the 5th generation trimmer.

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,199
With two interchangeable skin-safe blade heads.

159
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,199
Which makes it the ultimate sack worker without the pain or pews.

160
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,199
The package also comes with a weed worker 2.0.

161
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,199
The crop preserveer and the crop reviver.

162
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,199
The shed 2.0, the perfect place to keep everything in this package secure.

163
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,199

Go to Manscape and get rid of pubes fast.

168
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,199
How do you know Mike Tyson is anti-religion?

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,199
Anti-religion.

170
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,199
Because he always punches people in the faith.

172
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,199
In the face.

173
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,199
Ah.

174
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
I like you.

175
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,199
Does Pat explain to Pat and please explain to Pat.

176
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,199
There you go. He has a boxer. He's got a list.

177
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,199
He's got a list.

178
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,199
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
I'm good at chickening.

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
I like getting one.

181
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
Do you like getting one?

182
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,199
Is it better, are you sure?

183
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,199
I think it's better.

186
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,199
Oh my god.

187
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,199
I mean, I think she's a little funny.

188
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
One point to Rory.

190
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
Don't fight challenge.

193
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,199
Why is that so funny?

194
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,199
OK. OK.

195
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
OK.

196
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
What do you call a gay man in a wheelchair?

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
What?

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,199
A fruit roll up.

200
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,199
Oh my god.

201
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,199
Oh my god.

202
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
Oh jeez.

203
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
That was good.

204
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,199
Yeah, I think it's good. They're getting dark.

205
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:29,199
We got to dark off.

206
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
What's the best thing about being a test tube baby?

207
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
What's that?

208
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,199
Woon with a view.

209
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,199
Checked out.

210
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,199
What's the suicide bomb as biggest fear?

211
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
What?

212
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
Dying alone.

214
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,199
Jesus Christ.

215
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,199
To catch so fucking heck.

217
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,199
I'm the thing.

218
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,199
Suicide bomb as.

220
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,199
I love anal sex.

222
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
It's right up my alley.

225
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
I wrote that either.

227
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,199
I'm sorry.

229
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,199
I'm a little right up my alley.

230
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,199
Yeah.

231
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,199
I like to wear you said you like that.

233
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
You laugh.

234
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
Oh shit.

235
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm getting close to that point as well.

236
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
It's not good.

237
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Oh, this is just not nice tasting.

238
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
It doesn't taste nice.

240
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,200
Oh.

241
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Oh, okay.

242
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,200
You got this, you got this.

243
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,200
You got this girl.

244
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,200
What was the difference between a pregnant woman and a lot more?

245
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,200
What?

246
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
You can't unscrew a pregnant woman.

248
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You're a jack.

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
That's a good jack.

251
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
How was that?

252
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I know.

254
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,200
Yeah.

255
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Um...

256
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Why do police get to protest early?

257
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
To beat the crowd?

259
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Yeah.

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
Yeah.

261
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
You need a bit more from you guys.

262
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
Good energy, I mean.

265
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Thank you.

267
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You never...

269
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
What's the difference between a car key and a kid?

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
Oh god what?

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
A car key doesn't turn pad on.

274
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
That was good.

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,200
That was such a snuck and a felt in tummy.

277
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
That was bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

278
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,200
That was disgusting.

279
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Have you heard about the disease that only affects terrorists?

280
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I haven't known.

281
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Covid-9-11.

282
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Oh my god.

283
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,200
And that joke was brought to you by Taliban Airways.

285
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Always making sure your flight is a blast.

287
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Oh my god.

288
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Can you edit it like an ass?

289
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Please do say it.

290
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
That's a good thing.

291
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,200
That was bad Airways.

292
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
Always make sure your flight is a blast.

294
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
Use the code shaft to get 20% off your building.

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
It's a bad thing.

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
I don't want to go away with it too.

299
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Oh what's it?

301
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
No, no, that was a mistake.

302
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,200
Oh my god.

303
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
Oh, okay.

304
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh.

305
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
You're the bomb.

306
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
No, you're the bomb.

307
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
A compliment in the US, but an argument in the Middle East.

308
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
Oh my god.

310
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
That's pretty good.

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
You don't know that.

312
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
That was good.

313
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
That was a good joke.

314
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,200
I love.

315
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Did I love?

316
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
No.

317
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
No, good.

318
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
Hey, are you an American school?

319
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Because I want to shoot some kids into you.

320
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Oh my god.

321
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,200
I need no even to pick up minds.

322
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Oh my god.

323
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,200
I want to shoot some kids in you.

324
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
That's the French life.

325
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,200
What do you call an necrophilic gangbang?

326
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,200
What?

327
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,200
Cracking open a cold one with the boys.

328
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
Oh Jesus.

329
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Oh my god.

330
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
He shoots.

331
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
He'll...

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
Catherine.

333
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Catherine.

334
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Oh, through.

335
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
That's the ghost of the dead guy.

336
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Er...

337
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,200
What's pink and covered in cobwebs?

338
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Madeline McCann's bike bicycle.

339
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
Oh, dude.

340
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
Oh, oh.

341
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
Yeah, that is dark.

342
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I had another punch line for that one.

343
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,200
What's pink and covered in cobwebs?

344
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
Cat Spagina.

346
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
But I didn't want to say it.

347
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
He's like, no, I couldn't do that.

348
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I couldn't do that on camera.

349
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I didn't want to say that on camera.

350
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I think that's too rude.

351
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I didn't want to say that on camera.

352
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Look here.

353
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
Look here.

354
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I didn't say it on one camera.

355
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I didn't want to say it on that camera.

356
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,200
That's...

357
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
That's good.

358
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,200
That's good.

359
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I didn't say it on camera.

360
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
I didn't say it on camera.

361
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
That's bad.

362
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,200
That's bad.

363
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
It's the ones that the security guard...

364
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Oh, no.

365
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:21,200
The security guard comes over and bar and goes...

366
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,200
...blossom jokes for you mate.

367
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,200
And just list them all and sat there.

368
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I was just sharing a funeral once.

369
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,200
And it probably wouldn't have been so bad if the ringtone wasn't another one but it's the dust.

371
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,200
They're like, oh, do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do do.

373
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
They were polyphonic.

375
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
That's funny. That's good.

376
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Do do do do do do do do do.

378
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,200
That's fucking...

379
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
That should be the walk out song for this episode.

381
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Oh, there's a goo in.

382
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
There's only one thing that beats a girl with an amazing voice.

383
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
And that's Chris Brown.

385
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,200
Oh my god.

386
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
Oh my god.

387
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Shit, that was good.

388
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,200
Oh my god.

389
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Yeah, that's really...

390
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:22,200
Oh.

391
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,200
I'm back baby.

392
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,200
I love that, Jake.

393
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Rub it, sir.

395
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:39,200
What did the cops say when they shot a ginger person?

396
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,200
What?

397
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I guess orange is the new black.

399
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:51,200
That's great. That's good.

400
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
This one's for sound daddy, Dad.

401
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,200
Yeah. Yeah.

402
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Why do Indian women have a red dot on their head?

403
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,200
Because they never fucking listen.

404
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,200
Sam, that's...

405
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,200
Yeah.

406
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I'm so sorry.

407
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,200
Yeah, I go.

408
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,200
What can you say at both a birthday party and an execution?

409
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
What?

410
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Wait, let me go get the knife.

411
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
All right, last one.

412
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Matt, I'm gonna need your help on this one.

413
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
What happens when the Pope goes to the toilet?

414
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Holy shit!

417
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,200
You can't open it!

418
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,200
No!

419
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
How about this go?

420
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
Oh, 50.

421
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Oh, no, no, no, no.

422
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,200
No, no, no, no.

423
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,200
Oh, shit!

424
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,200
I was so worried he wouldn't be be asleep with something.
