1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
What's the difference between Batman and a black man?

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
Don't know.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,799
Yeah.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,000
Hey, everyone's going off, baby.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Hi.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Nice to see you.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It's nice to not be fighting each other.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I know.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I know.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm going to give you little legs under here.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Let me get you.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
That's tarry good.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
OK, let's start the line.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm going home.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'm this guy.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, we're putting the BJ and BBJ.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
That's a really good start.

18
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
OK, let's go.

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Says the better rock.

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Yeah.

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Says Pay, per rock.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Fuck.

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
All right.

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Do you want to go first?

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'll let you go first.

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
OK, here we go.

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
All right, you guys know the rules.

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's kick it off.

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'll go first, joke.

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think you're going to start off with a joke about jump ropes.

31
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
No, hang on.

32
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'll skip that.

33
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That was very good.

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
That was very good.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you.

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That was very funny.

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That was, yeah, a little awesome.

38
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The delivery could be better.

39
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm glad someone explained it to me because I didn't know I knew.

40
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Why did they call them sausage rolls?

41
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Why?

42
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
They don't go anywhere.

43
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They should be called sausage steels.

44
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
That's that dumb.

45
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I love it.

46
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You love to achieve fat.

47
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What's that?

48
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Which one's fat?

49
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't walk you in on this dad masturbator.

50
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
What the fuck?

51
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
What?

52
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, I don't know why I'm laughing.

53
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It just reminds me of my childhood.

54
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What's a dad?

55
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
OK, a boy walks in on his dad masturbating.

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The boy goes, Dad, what are you doing?

57
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And the dad goes, I'm masturbating.

58
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You'll know about it soon.

59
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And the kid goes, what do you mean?

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And he goes, well, my arm's getting tired.

61
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh.

62
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hit it, foul, Pat.

63
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hit it, foul, Pat.

64
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hit it, foul, Pat.

65
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's a family thing.

66
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What the family joke about messy baby?

67
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I still don't know.

68
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I still don't know.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I still don't know what they like at.

70
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
They like it.

71
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They like it.

72
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They like it.

73
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Get out of here now.

74
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Get out of here now.

75
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Good work.

76
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All right.

77
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey, girls.

78
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey, how are you?

79
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Welcome to the table.

80
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Thank you.

81
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hello.

82
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hello.

83
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Do you want me to go first?

84
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yes, for sure.

85
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I got an air fryer the other day.

86
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Wow.

87
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I couldn't figure out how to make it work.

88
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because I was just holding it up in the air.

89
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nothing was frying.

90
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Classic pain.

91
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Classic pain.

92
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Really good.

93
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Thanks.

94
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I loved it.

95
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What did the Mexican photographer name his daughter?

96
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What?

97
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Cameradillas.

98
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know.

99
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The same algorithm of jokes.

100
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Why do Americans eat like their health care is free?

101
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know what I'm saying?

102
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah.

103
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why?

104
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
That's the joke.

105
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's the joke.

106
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
That was unreal.

107
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeah.

108
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Yay.

109
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why?

110
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I love it.

111
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Two America.

112
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Murr.

113
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you.

114
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You're welcome.

115
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Maddie's out.

116
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's my ring.

117
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Maddie's ring.

118
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not a girl.

119
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yeah.

120
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Yeah.

121
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yeah.

122
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's the joke.

123
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That's the joke.

124
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's the joke.

125
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
That's the joke.

126
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
That's the joke.

127
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
That's the joke.

128
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah.

129
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let's try the recording.

130
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, shit.

131
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, that was like a...

132
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Shit, redhead.

133
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I was saying, as well...

134
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your wig is looking really nice today.

135
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It is.

136
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It is.

137
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's your wig.

138
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not a song.

139
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I thought I sang it out of there.

140
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Not me.

141
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Sorry.

142
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's the female equivalent of tea bagging called a flappuccino?

143
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
That's how you feel.

144
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's so weird.

145
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We're so outnumbered.

146
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's not funny.

147
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's cool.

148
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's cool.

149
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's cool.

150
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hold it together, Maddie.

151
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hold it together, Maddie.

152
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's cool.

153
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's cool.

154
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
That's cool.

155
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah.

156
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, yeah.

157
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That was a little mooseball.

158
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah.

159
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He had to flat-life.

160
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Oh.

161
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not.

162
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I'm not.

163
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm not.

164
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's not a long black.

165
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
All right.

166
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
All right.

167
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right.

168
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
All right.

169
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

170
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What does Ted Bundy and the cast of your mad have in common?

171
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Which one tell me?

172
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They love a cold one.

173
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh.

174
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh.

175
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yeah.

176
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's for me.

177
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
That's a man.

178
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was waiting for him to go out.

179
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I wrote that.

180
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I did.

181
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I wrote it.

182
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How did the park get his lesbian sister laid?

183
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know.

184
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah, someone does.

185
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Is there me sister?

186
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't hear you.

188
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can't hear you.

189
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't hear you.

190
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, dude.

191
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Cheers.

192
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Cheers.

193
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's very funny, Maddie.

194
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's very funny.

195
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Thank you.

196
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thank you.

197
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you.

198
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you.

199
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, thank you.

200
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you.

201
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, thank you.

202
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you.

203
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you.

204
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Great job.

205
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Any normal alcohol with you?

206
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There you go.

207
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I think my head is looking good.

208
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Your head does look great.

209
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't hurt.

210
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah.

211
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it only took eight hours.

212
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's when I get done.

213
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
That's when I get done.

214
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You sound like the parrot on the parrot.

215
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's when I get done.

216
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, you know the cracker.

217
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's good.

218
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, you know the cracker.

219
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is how it's not taking sass.

220
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know the cracker.

221
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Oh, my God.

222
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's see what we see.

223
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Let's see what we see.

224
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're cold.

225
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're locked.

226
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It's a lock.

227
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's a lock.

228
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,740
Sit over there, I'm going to keep rolling with the pirate jokes.

229
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:23,279
What's the difference between a casual dinner party and a pirate orgy?

230
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,500
One of them, you come as you are and the other, you are as you come.

231
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,000
You are.

232
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Errrr.

233
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Is that how you guys do it?

234
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
I hope not.

235
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It's too many words for me, so it's a bit.

236
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
It's actually a myth.

237
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
There's a mail-on going on.

238
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
How many is it?

239
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
Yeah, never happened to.

240
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:52,500
What do you call a prostituted wheelchair?

241
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Park and ride.

242
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
What?

243
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Park and ride?

244
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,500
So when my uncle Frank died, he wanted his remains to be buried in his favourite bear mug.

245
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:12,500
His last wish was to be Frank and Stein.

246
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
That's really good.

247
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
What an innocent.

248
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,500
A Stein is what you drink beer out of him.

249
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Stop man's playing with me.

250
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,500
I'm actually blind.

251
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,500
What's a disabled kid's favourite swoon?

252
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Stroke.

253
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
I know this one.

254
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:42,500
I don't think it is because I cooked this joke already.

255
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,500
What?

256
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,500
What's a disabled kid's favourite?

257
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Sit down there, Ross.

258
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,500
It's gone for it.

259
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
What?

260
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,500
He's a disabled kid's favourite.

261
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Don't interrupt me.

262
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,500
I don't think it is.

263
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Don't interrupt me.

264
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,500
What's a disabled kid's favourite swooning position?

265
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,500
The stroke.

266
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
No, it's not.

267
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,500
It's run-off ride.

268
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Is that an Asian disabled kid's run-off ride?

269
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,500
That's going in and behind the scenes.

270
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
That's not making a real one.

271
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,500
That's a different one.

272
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Out of the segment or out of your mat?

273
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:42,500
It's all big.

274
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
It's all big.

275
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Reading today is not good.

276
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,500
I met out with someone who smokes.

277
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,500
I call it my nicotine passions.

278
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,500
That's really a sicker.

279
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I like it.

280
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
It's a lie.

281
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
I don't like it.

282
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,500
Push his leg.

283
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:13,500
What did one saggy boob say to the other saggy boob?

284
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,500
If we don't get the proper support, people are going to think they're nuts.

285
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,500
That's good.

286
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Do you know how to make a water bed more bouncy?

287
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,500
You put in spring water.

288
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,500
It's just getting the balls breaks.

289
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh my god.

290
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Is that a laugh?

291
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
A laugh?

292
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I don't know which piece.

293
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Don't drink me, be gentle.

294
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Every time you drink bobbierin.

295
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,500
You deserve it.

296
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:54,500
You've knocked out two people.

297
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
We're going in dog.

298
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
This is yours.

299
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Yours is the cold one.

300
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Thanks, bro.

301
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
I'll pray shake you.

302
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Why does it look like two of the sound guys are telling jokes to each other?

303
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
My not really reported.

304
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
You're up.

305
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I got a job as a senior director at Old McDonald's Farm.

306
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Yeah, I'm the CIA.

307
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
That's too loud.

308
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,500
That was cute.

309
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,500
I would've loved to hear Timmy tell that joke.

310
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
Timmy spells his name with a one.

311
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
Timmy spells his name with a one.

312
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
I'll start as well.

313
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
It's the one backwards.

314
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
I'll challenge it.

315
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,500
I'll get a long one for you.

316
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,500
There's a teacher in the classroom.

317
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Today we're going to be spelling words that end in eight and eat things.

318
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,500
One guy goes alligator.

319
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,500
Teacher goes fantastic.

320
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Another one goes calculator.

321
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Teacher goes no, that doesn't mean anything.

322
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Doesn't work.

323
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
One kid goes vibrator.

324
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Teacher goes look, that doesn't work.

325
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
It doesn't eat things.

326
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
The kid goes well, my mum says it chew through batteries.

327
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
I'm at 80 HD.

328
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,500
That's a good one.

329
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,500
That's still the first one as well.

330
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:33,500
That's still singing it here.

331
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah.

332
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,500
That's just how he got an adult joke.

333
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Yeah.

334
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Every word of a duck, a duck, a duck, a duck.

335
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Okay.

336
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I was like the Lord of the Rings of Jokes man, that was fucking forever brother.

337
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
Back again.

338
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
Hello Patrick.

339
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:04,500
Where does someone go if they injure themselves during a game of pickle boot?

340
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
I see you.

341
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I hate that I laughed at that.

342
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I hate that I laughed at that.

343
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
That's good.

344
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Cheers.

345
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,500
You're a baby once a day.

346
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I see you.

347
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,500
Welcome back to the table.

348
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,500
I met a guy from North Korea and asked him what his country was like.

349
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Yeah.

350
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
What's it like again?

351
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
She's about to tell you.

352
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Well he said he can't complain.

353
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I knew it.

354
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,500
That is really, really good.

355
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
What's the difference between Batman and a black man?

356
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:52,500
Batman can go out at night time without Robin.

357
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
That's a good joke.

358
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,500
That's a great joke.

359
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I just want to let everyone know that another white guy told me that.

360
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
So it should be fine.

361
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
Yeah, it was Robin.

362
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I got fired from my job for prank calling 911.

363
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,500
My boss told me it was just plain wrong.

364
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,500
That's a great joke.

365
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
They don't get it.

366
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
None, 11?

367
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Yeah.

368
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
That's always fine.

369
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
It's a plain joke.

370
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
Well done.

371
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
Well done, man.

372
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Thanks guys.

373
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,500
A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says,

374
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Hey, we've got a drink named after you.

375
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
A grasshopper says, you got a drink named Steve?

376
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Did you like that one?

377
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Oh, yeah.

378
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
It was the delivery.

379
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
It was great.

380
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I really liked that joke.

381
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It was good.

382
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,500
Cheers.

383
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Cheers.

384
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
There you go.

385
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,500
That was very well done.

386
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Thank you.

387
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Back once again.

388
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Bye.

389
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Oh, oh, oh.

390
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Do you want to go first?

391
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
I want me to go first.

392
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
I feel like you're loaded with one.

393
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
I'm not really.

394
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Okay, I'll go first.

395
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Okay.

396
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
What does a Tasmanian chick say after a good rude?

397
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
What?

398
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Happy Father's Day.

399
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Oh, my fucking God.

400
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
She a whole bar.

401
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
That was great, Maddie.

402
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Thank you.

403
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
That was great.

404
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Say all you want about pedophiles,

405
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:35,500
but they always drive really slow in a school zone.

406
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I just had another lesson.

407
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,500
I just had another lesson.

408
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
I just had another lesson.

409
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
But you walk real slow.

410
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
You got this, babe.

411
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,500
You got this.

412
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
You're driving bombs.

413
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Go Maddie.

414
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
You're driving bombs.

415
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Slot jokes are just horrible.

416
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Holy shit.

417
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
You're holy shit in yourself.

418
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,500
You're holy shit in yourself.

419
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
You're gonna do that.

420
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Holy shit in yourself.

421
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,500
You're gonna do that.

422
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Holy shit.

423
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,500
Oh, I missed it.

424
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
That was a really good one.

425
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I took a sip of that again.

426
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,500
You were really good.

427
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
You were really good.

428
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,500
You were really good.

429
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
That was a really good one.

430
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
You were really good.

431
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
See?

432
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Hey.

433
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Oh, my God.

434
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Oh, my God.

435
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,500
Oh, my God.

436
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh, my God.

437
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
You're crazy with me.

438
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Yeah.

439
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
See you next round.

440
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
What's your score, man?

441
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Six.

442
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,500
Six existem.

443
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Six all.

444
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Six all.

445
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Six existem.

446
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Yeah, man.

447
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
You were really, man.

448
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
You were really good.

449
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Yeah, what do you call a Stone Kid with Down Syndrome?

450
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
What the fuck?

451
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
What?

452
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I know what Timmy punched me in the good?

453
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
You fucking jokes?

454
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,500
What?

455
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
A baked potato.

456
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Well, he missed a punch line.

457
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Stapho, yes.

458
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
I'm gonna get it.

459
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Stapho, yes.

460
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
She's just showing.

461
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm like, it's not a guess though.

462
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,940
Jesus showered.

463
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,440
He's so cute.

464
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,279
Oh, okay.

465
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,120
Okay, okay, okay.

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,139
A bag of ten.

467
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:06,980
No.

468
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
No.

469
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,820
No.

470
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,820
No.

471
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,820
No.

472
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,820
No.

473
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,820
No.

474
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,820
No.

475
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,820
No.

476
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:15,820
No.

477
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,820
No.

478
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,820
No.

479
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,820
No.

480
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
No.

481
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,820
No.

482
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
No.

483
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,820
No.

484
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,820
No.

485
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,820
No.

486
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,820
No.

487
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
No.

488
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,820
No.

489
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,660
No.

490
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,660
No.

491
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,140
I told you.

492
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,140
I told you.

493
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,460
It's not the whole joke.

494
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,200
The whole joke.

495
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,360
That was a joke.

496
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,540
Tell it the joke again, pass it over.

497
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,740
Give it up.

498
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,780
Then my neck step higher that he fucking let his нout.

499
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,820
Oh is that his sword.

500
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,580
Check this out.

501
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,460
How apart of him.

502
00:16:57,460 --> 00:17:02,460
What do you call a petafile with no legs?

503
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,460
A creepy crawly.

504
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,460
Oh!

505
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,460
I've got this tiny hole in the gap.

506
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,460
It's like a bug.

507
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,460
Damn it.

508
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Yeah.

509
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,460
A creepy crawly, okay?

510
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,460
How do you give a bogey a compliment?

511
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,460
Telling me, has a nice teeth.

512
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,460
How do you give pada compliment?

513
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,460
No one's got it!

514
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
None of you.

515
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:33,460
Did you have an opportunity to complete the joke?

516
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Just thought Roy would have interrupted.

517
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Roy!

518
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Roy!

519
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Roy!

520
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,460
Roy!

521
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,460
You're way right to finish the joke.

522
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
Roy, finish the joke.

523
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,460
Yeah, one job, Roy.

524
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
Don't say that.

525
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,460
To finish your joke, say that.

526
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,460
Just like a dog.

527
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,460
Oh, I heard it.

528
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,460
I heard it.

529
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,460
I heard it.

530
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,460
What did you have written to me?

531
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,460
I don't think you had anything written.

532
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,460
You know what I mean?

533
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,460
You guys.

534
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,460
You literally...

535
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,460
What do you mean?

536
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,460
I finished the joke.

537
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
You're up for joke to me.

538
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,460
You did it.

539
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,460
You did it.

540
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Next week on your man's head.

541
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,460
Shut up.

542
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Yeah, yeah.

543
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,460
You did it to me.

544
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,460
Oh, my next thing when it just set up.

545
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,460
It looks like a...

546
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,460
You say what I'm dead, man.

547
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,460
Why you doing knock-knocks and no one answers?

548
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,460
Why did you kick a guy's around?

549
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,460
I'm just kidding.

550
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,460
Oh my god.

551
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,460
I know you've been an Englishman and you've surely walked into a bar.

552
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,460
What did you want me to say?

553
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:41,460
I don't know, just something funny.

554
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Oh my god.

555
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,460
You got a cat.

556
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,460
You'll finish whatever joke you write.

557
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,460
I don't know if he's going to keep up with his phone again.

558
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,460
Oh, no, no.

559
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,460
Tell me then.

560
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,460
No, I'm not going to use that.

561
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,460
No, there's a couple.

562
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,460
Oh, shit.

563
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,460
It's a couple.

564
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,460
So Mickey Mouse gets a call from his lawyer.

565
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,460
That tells him, Mickey, I'm sorry, you can't divorce Minnie just because she's funny.

566
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Mickey then says, I didn't say she was funny.

567
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
I said she was fucking goofy.

568
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,460
No!

569
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,460
Does that have to laugh at that boy?

570
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
What?

571
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
I love that boy.

572
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
Get him off.

573
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
Oh, Tim.

574
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,460
I wasn't going to use this.

575
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,460
No, I said, no.

576
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
No, I didn't say this.

577
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
I told you.

578
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,460
I'll let them drink their drinks.

579
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,460
Oh, my god.

580
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,460
Oh, dear.

581
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,460
Oh, thanks, good.

582
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,460
Love you, Tim.

583
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,460
Oh, my god.

584
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
Oh, again.

585
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Hey.

586
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,460
Hey.

587
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,460
Hey.

588
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,460
Hi.

589
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,460
What's going on?

590
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,460
Hey.

591
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,460
Tell me a joke.

592
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,460
So I bought a new car.

593
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,460
I bought a Hyundai accent.

594
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,460
Do you like to go with an accent?

595
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,460
It's the wrong car.

596
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,460
It's the wrong car.

597
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,460
That's okay.

598
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,460
That's a great joke.

599
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Why are there no pharmacies in Africa?

600
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,460
Oh, no.

601
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,460
Oh, dear.

602
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
It's going where exactly where you think it's going.

603
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,460
Oh, okay.

604
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,460
Why?

605
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,460
You basically can't take meds on an empty stomach.

606
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Oh.

607
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Yeah.

608
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
Couching on a dirty couch.

609
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
Couching on a dirty couch.

610
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Couching on a dirty couch.

611
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,460
I do love people like that.

612
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
That's me.

613
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
I'll just make it back to you.

614
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
I'll make it back to you.

615
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
I'm going to say something.

616
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,460
Yeah.

617
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Oh, my god.

618
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,460
Oh, my god.

619
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Yeah.

620
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
Oh, that's not going to be true.

621
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,460
What was that?

622
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
That's not going to be true.
