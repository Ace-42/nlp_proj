1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The expectation, the hopes for this will be how

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
really Scott's involved, Harrison, you were involved.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
But presumably, this isn't the first time I just involved him.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You're in it! You're in it!

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You're on the poster!

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
APPLAUSE

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But, okay, my question is this.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
So it must have been mentions of a sequel between...

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It was 1982, wasn't it? When it came out.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So between then and now, so why now, why not before?

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I guess because Ryan wasn't available.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
LAUGHTER

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
For many years, he wasn't available.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes, well, not for 30 years.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But they were waiting for me to grow up.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
But they decided they have to go ahead anyway.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
No, they finally came up with a good story.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I read it and I thought it was awesome.

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought it was great.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And as I read it, I read about the character that...

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Ryan?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It's Ryan.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
LAUGHTER

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I came to play and I said...

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And with great enthusiasm, I called up the producers and I said,

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this is great. I can't wait to give up.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And a great part.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why don't we see if we can get...

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Ryan.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Ryan and Gosling.

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And they said...

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't know how to rosy.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Rosy.

35
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yes.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ryan got that on tape.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And I said, why not?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This is a great part for Ryan Gosling.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
LAUGHTER

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And they said we've been talking to him for months.

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Now wait a second.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
They'd only been talking to me for weeks.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
So, at last I'm sure you're all too.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It was promoting a film.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
She didn't know who she was playing in the film.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It was finished. It was in the cinema.

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It was a long time after we'd filmed it.

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You might have checked before you came on a chat show.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I really love her. I know she is.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I have no idea.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't know why this...

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They also...

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
...contractually know a fence, but it was sort of asked to come.

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I thought...

55
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
But I love you too.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
No, no, no.

57
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Wow.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
She doesn't mean that.

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't know.

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You see why...

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
She doesn't want to be here, Liam.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, no, no, no, no.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I love Graham.

65
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But I do wonder why they asked me to do it.

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't help. Do I?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No.

68
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
No!

69
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No!

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I... I... I...

71
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I... I...

72
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I...

73
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I...

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I...

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I...

76
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I...

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I...

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I...

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I...

80
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I...

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So, who did you meet at the Golden Globes?

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Ah...

83
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How long you got, man? It's just like...

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Oh, so...

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Did you meet these guys at the Golden Globes?

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No.

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I met...

88
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I met her before.

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was a woman's governor's...

90
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
She was really cool when we just spoke about stuff.

91
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It was really nice.

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And then her...

93
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I met... I met...

94
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I met her...

95
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Good story.

96
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It was really nice.

97
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It was really nice for us to meet.

98
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It was cool.

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It was really nice.

100
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I kind of believe he was English,

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
because his accent was so flawless and get out.

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
And I was like, oh my god.

103
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And anytime I meet anyone who's English,

104
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm just immediately like, I love London.

105
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I miss it.

106
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you live there?

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Ah, I do.

108
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So you talk about London?

109
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

110
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Which I was like, yeah, I'm...

111
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
And then I met...

112
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I met...

113
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What happened, yeah?

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I met Denzel.

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Ooh.

116
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I met Denzel...

117
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I met Denzel in Oprah at the same time.

118
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It was...

119
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It was this segue.

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It was just like...

121
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know.

122
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Like, African-American excellence segue.

123
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I don't know what happened.

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'd say, Denzel came up to me.

125
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was like, oh, he came to me, English accent.

126
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He was like, yeah, mate.

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Cheers, mate. Cheers, mate. Cheers, mate.

128
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
And I'm like, what...

129
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What's happening?

130
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How do you know who I am?

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And he was like...

132
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And then he went to his wife like,

133
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he thinks I don't know who he is.

134
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And then he goes, come meet Oprah.

135
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And then I was like, oh, come meet Oprah.

136
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's meet Oprah.

137
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And then I just...

138
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, I'm a hugger.

139
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
A hugger is so tightly in there.

140
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She felt so good, man.

141
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She felt good.

142
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Apparently she smells weird.

143
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
She has an amazing smell.

144
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
She smells amazing, Graham.

145
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I swear.

146
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Oprah is just premium.

147
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can the risk of the crash?

148
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Have you got some more, Oprah?

149
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I thought she smelled amazing.

150
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I've never met Oprah.

151
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But when I do, I'm gonna hug her for sure.

152
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm gonna smell her.

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
At the Golden Globes, but she was too far away.

154
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
You go out in hell deeply.

155
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm telling you we're walking.

156
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
We're walking out in hell deeply.

157
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm just sniffing there.

158
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
No, I know why.

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
That was suddenly such a nice smell in the room.

160
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, sure.

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No, she was really cool.

162
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It was really strong.

163
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Now, I hate to pick on Eddie.

164
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Come on.

165
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What?

166
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Eddie, your...

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, we were just saying, your sexual awakening

168
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
was sort of...

169
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Was it two-dimensional sexual awakening?

170
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Oh, God.

171
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No, it's true.

172
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was once interviewed and I was like,

173
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
who would it your first crushes?

174
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
And I did...

175
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I loved the Lion King when I was younger

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
and I had a weird obsession with Nala.

177
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's for you.

178
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's for you.

179
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Look at her face. She's so sweet.

180
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
That's your thing really well.

181
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That's wrong.

182
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That is so wrong.

183
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it true you like made Marion as well?

184
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, that is true. She's a foxter.

185
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What, I have that too.

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Well, do you?

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, there's...

188
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, no, no. But in Eddie's...

189
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
In Eddie's defense, they draw them really sexy.

190
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What is do you like Robin Hood?

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I heard what he's got to say.

192
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The thought Robin Hood, there he is.

193
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
And that tunic is worn very low, I notice.

194
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yeah, you mean he's packing.

195
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
My first attempt at Standard Comedy.

196
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And what happened was I...

197
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I'd always wanted to do Standard Comedy.

198
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I didn't have the guts to do it.

199
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I got very drunk. I had a go at doing it as a blue coat.

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
My mate said to me,

201
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
just copy all the other comedians at Pontings

202
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and steal their jokes

203
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
and basically talk to the front row.

204
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So you're supposed to say, what are you from?

205
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Scotland, you say, who paid for your holiday?

206
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Where you're from, Wales?

207
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You make an always like a sheep. Rubbish jokes, all right?

208
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But I said, that's terrible.

209
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He said, don't worry, you're just padding.

210
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What you're doing is you're looking for comedy gold,

211
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
which is, where you're from, they say Kent.

212
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
And you say, what did you call me?

213
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Now at Pontings, this used to take the roof off, right?

214
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
So I tried it, but I was very drunk.

215
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I go on stage,

216
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and I say, where are you from?

217
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm from Scotland. I can't remember the joke.

218
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I say, hello.

219
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Then I said to, where are you from?

220
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The guy says, Wales.

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'd black out and I go, hi.

222
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hi, panic.

223
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And then I say, anyone in from Kent?

224
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And this bloke shout's out me.

225
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And I said, well, you're a f***er.

226
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
LAUGHTER

227
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So I miss him.

228
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm trying to walk him.

229
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I know people always end these things,

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but I swear to God, that's a true story.

231
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That is the baitsome.

232
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's still in practice.

233
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello.

234
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hello. Hi, yeah.

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What's your name?

236
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
My name is Eileen.

237
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Eileen.

238
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yep.

239
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm guessing you're from Ireland.

240
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I am from Dairy.

241
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're from Dairy up to the north of the country.

242
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And you live there or here?

243
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I started here.

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I live over there.

245
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Oh, what are you doing?

246
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Clostum design.

247
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Clostum interpretation.

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
There will be subtitles on Friday.

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know.

250
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Right now, only I can understand the meaning of it.

251
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I can't understand that too.

252
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I know.

253
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I can't.

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No.

255
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
So far you're not missing anything.

256
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've never heard of costume interpretation before.

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It's like costume design, isn't it?

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Except fancier.

259
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fancier, it's fancier, Frank.

260
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, yeah.

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Oh, yeah.

262
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
All the labour.

263
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
LAUGHTER

264
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
OK. I'll be going.

265
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right.

266
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So lead up to Christmas.

267
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I was back home.

268
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
And I had a good night.

269
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Exactly.

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Right.

271
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Did you get any of it?

272
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Something about Christmas.

273
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yeah, Christmas.

274
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
That's the only good detail so far.

275
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Because you said, just pick out where it's you'll follow the story.

276
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Let's say blah, blah, blah.

277
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Christmas, blah, blah, home.

278
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I went into the shop and I had to get milk and bread.

279
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
LAUGHTER

280
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
LAUGHTER

281
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So I literally was really stressed.

282
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So I was like, I want to get the groceries.

283
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Let's go.

284
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Told my boyfriend to do a lap and just pack me up.

285
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No need to park the car.

286
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
So as planned, I came out, you know, perfect timing.

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Silver people's car are casually drifted by casual speed.

288
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
So without hesitation, I sprint across.

289
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:04,000
When my groceries jump in the back of the car, screaming and thumping the back of the chair,

290
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
and go, go, go, go, go.

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
But taking a mind, it was Christmas, and I had like a scarf up here and a hat.

292
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
LAUGHTER

293
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I got, which was my boyfriend, torn going to be this middle age, like, 60-year-old woman.

294
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Scoring men.

295
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Jesus!

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I pushed her foot on the accelerator and then I was doing a little post.

297
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh!

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's found a selection of poor and sometimes, frankly, essentially, lazy translations into English on foreign menus.

299
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
So imagine we're all in a restaurant together and I turned to stand.

300
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I said, what are you going to get?

301
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And Stanley might reply, well, I'm going to get the sausage and the father-in-law.

302
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
LAUGHTER

303
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
LAUGHTER

304
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Look at that possibly being!

305
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't know, but the images that conjures up...

306
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It must be some sort of told in the whole.

307
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes.

308
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's getting worse.

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This, this is it, I mean, really.

310
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I mean, I don't think anybody...

311
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's a fake relative, isn't it?

312
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yeah, I do.

313
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And I don't think anyone wants this German-type sexual harassment.

314
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
LAUGHTER

315
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah.

316
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I don't think it can go wrong with a nice place of...

317
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
hand-shredded ass meat.

318
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh, everyone's favourite towards the more.

319
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Just another handful.

320
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do we have next?

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What's going on with that?

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Stanley, you'd know what wine goes with it.

323
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Wine, damn.

324
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think a wine pairing menu.

325
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh, this is a special brunch for the weekend.

326
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I might have the fresh-allowed potlify of a variety of opinions.

327
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I like that.

328
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You can almost imagine that in a menu.

329
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

330
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Under a magic costume.

331
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
That's like parliament.

332
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I mean, they serve in parliament.

333
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But then sometimes people are just a bit lazy.

334
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
So this one, there's bigger menu.

335
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There's some smoke cow feet.

336
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And then they just cow something.

337
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
LAUGHTER

338
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I looked it up.

339
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
There wasn't there.

340
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Just cow something.

341
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't know.

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Just...

343
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I knew it.

344
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's beef in it. Just have it.

345
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But that person took a bit of trouble.

346
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
This next person couldn't be bothered at all.

347
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Item number two on the menu.

348
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Whatever.

349
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Food in it.

350
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Food.

351
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Have it.

352
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
It's only you did.

353
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Now you meet again.

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Forever.

355
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
We move on to dessert now, ladies and gentlemen.

356
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh.

357
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh.

358
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Let's all have a bowl of...

359
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No, sweet scum.

360
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What's next with scum?

361
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You can get strawberries with scum as well.

362
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And we really want to push the boat out.

363
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Why not have some chocolate puke?

364
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
LAUGHTER

365
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Everything...

366
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We would put it in the tank.

367
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm looking for a tap.

368
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And finally, is there anyone who live who doesn't like sweet tight push?

369
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sweet tight pussy.

370
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
LAUGHTER

371
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Well, all the band he translated through.

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Isn't it true?

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
And this seems unlikely that you own a single piece of every bit of memorabilia

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
that they produced for Lord of the Rings.

375
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Oh. Well, that's half true.

376
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So I've got a few things from the actual films.

377
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So I have the ring, I have sting, I have a map from Bilbo's study

378
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
or the living room in Bagend.

379
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And I just recently, because I went back and did the final bit on the Hobbit.

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And they gave me the book that Bilbo writes in.

381
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
He writes the Hobbit there in Mac again, a Hobbit's Tale.

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
And then I finish it as Lord of the Rings.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They gave me that red volume, which is beautiful.

384
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Yeah.

385
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And with my last day in Hobbitin, it was pretty magical.

386
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, no.

387
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
It was amazing.

388
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hobbitin.

389
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
And then...

390
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Oh, come on, you're in the Hobbit City.

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This is a set.

392
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's a real...

393
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a real place.

394
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
They've actually...

395
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I think no, it's not.

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's a real place.

397
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's like a real tree.

398
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't you screw up your tree.

399
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So they've...

400
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
His feet are big too.

401
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They've actually built it.

402
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We built it for Lord of the Rings.

403
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We took all of the facades away.

404
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
And then it's since been a tourist attraction.

405
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And now it's been rebuilt for the Hobbit,

406
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
but with sustainable materials, with real woods.

407
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
So it'll always be there.

408
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So from now on, you'll actually get to see Hobbitin and visit it

409
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
as a real place.

410
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And we'll be...

411
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, can you...

412
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Can you stay there?

413
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You can't stay there.

414
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
No.

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But they are turning the green dragon cub into a visitor center.

416
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, no, be too big for a tree.

417
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
You want to help people coming in?

418
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where's my bedroom?

419
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Please, Vicer.

420
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Here's the jacuzzi.

421
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's see how we go.

422
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's get it going, my baby.

423
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Wow.

424
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hobbitin.

425
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
So people are going, yes, we're going to Hobbitin for Christmas.

426
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I turned 19 when we first went to Hobbitin.

427
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
And I was 30 now.

428
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I was talking to Pete when we were there on my last dance.

429
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And you realized that I had my 19th birthday in Hobbitin.

430
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yeah.

431
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And wild?

432
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Wild.

433
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
So you put some things into perspective.

434
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah.

435
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I mean, people can say that I had my birthday party in Hobbitin.

436
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hobbitin.

437
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I don't circumcised it Disneyland.

438
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
It's even no one could have known.

439
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
But it was going to take off and become a real place.

440
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Stop it.

441
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's like a real place.

442
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a tourist industry place.

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
So that's...

444
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It would look getting into New Zealand, asshole.

445
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I know.

446
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What's your next turn?

447
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
A super-dominant.

448
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
What was it going to be?

449
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I want a theme.

450
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's Graham Norden.

451
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Come on, Graham. Good luck on you.

452
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Yeah.

453
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
He's a Hobbit denial.

454
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
He doesn't believe in Hobbit.
