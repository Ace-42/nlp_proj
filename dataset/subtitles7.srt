1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,400
The big thing fans are of course is fan art and Sarah Pasco I know you have had that accolade of people sending you fan art.

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:11,200
I mean get one piece and I think fan art is a strong word.

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,599
We've got to pick it should we see it first?

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,000
Yes, okay, so it's me.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,199
Actually, it's worth saying that it's all of you.

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:20,199
It's all of me.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,800
It is what this is the fan art of Sarah Pasco.

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,800
Now the reason I think fan art is a very loose term is I was given this as a gig in lieu of payment.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,799
I just want to brag about my career.

10
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:35,799
Yeah.

11
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:36,799
Well.

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,799
But that's because the guy who ran the gig had spent too much at the bar to pay me.

13
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:42,799
So he painted that, yes.

14
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:44,799
After being at the bar.

15
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,799
Of me.

16
00:00:45,799 --> 00:00:47,799
What are those bits?

17
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,799
I just think they're just free biscuits.

18
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,799
I'm not so something.

19
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:58,799
You've been sent pictures of people who tattooed your face on their body.

20
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,799
Oh, no, I'm not there yet.

21
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:02,799
You got one day.

22
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:03,799
Yeah.

23
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:05,799
I get them in my Twitter feed all the time.

24
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,799
It's guys with a whole cab, the cash or a picture of jewels on their chest or Nick Fury.

25
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,799
You know people love, and now Tom Edelston, you have fan art but such specific fan art.

26
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,799
There's a lot.

27
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,799
And does it all come with this one scene?

28
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,799
It was at the first Thor movie with the spear?

29
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:25,799
Right, right.

30
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:26,799
Yes.

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,799
There's a scene in a first Thor film where I'm trying to attack Thor, Chris Hemsworth, as Thor with the spear.

32
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,799
And I jump in the air and he dodges out the way and I bring the spear down and wedges itself into the floor.

33
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:55,799
And then I use it to spin myself around and kick him in the chest, which has been interpreted by fans as a demonstration of my hidden talent at pole dancing.

34
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:56,799
Pole dancing.

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
Yeah, no, no.

36
00:01:58,799 --> 00:01:59,799
No, no, no.

37
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,799
There's so much of this.

38
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,799
This is just one example of Loki really going for it on the pole.

39
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:08,800
Oh, my God.

40
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Is that Japanese French?

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
That's what you wear in the movie.

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
I've not seen it.

43
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Yeah, that's Loki's outfit.

44
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
Yeah, I've not seen that one.

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
Oh, really?

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,800
I will print it out.

47
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You can take it in.

48
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Wow.

49
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Very quickly.

50
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
It is Oscar's weekend, this weekend.

51
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:37,800
And Ian, would you mind telling us the story about when you were nominated for Dandalf?

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
Yeah, Dandalf.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Oh, yeah.

54
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
And you had the beads.

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah.

56
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Well, there were beads in New Zealand where we filmed Lord the Rings.

57
00:02:50,800 --> 00:03:02,800
If you're lucky, when you leave, you're given a piece of green stone carved and you wear it often enough and your chances are you'll get back to New Zealand.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
That's the idea.

59
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,800
And it will bring you a bit of luck.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:17,800
So when those films were nominated for something like 20 Oscars on that night, everybody from New Zealand was wearing the green stone, the Poonami, they're called.

61
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,800
And when we're on the red carpet going into the ceremony, Maggie Smith, you know, what are you here for?

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:32,800
I said, well, Lord of the Rings, oh, yeah.

63
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
She said, what's that round?

64
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,800
Your neck?

65
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I said, it's my Poonami, Maggie.

66
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,800
I only have Poonami.

67
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
What's that fight?

68
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, if I wear it, it'll bring me luck.

69
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I don't know.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Very nice.

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
And we went to our separate ways.

72
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
And you know it lasts for three and a half or four hours.

73
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
You know, don't you?

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
Oh, God.

75
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
You sit there and sit there.

76
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,800
And at the end, of course, everyone else wins the Oscar apart from you.

77
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,800
And a bit dejected, you're coming out looking forward to a drink and you're bumping to Maggie Smith and she points out and you're just saying, didn't work.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,800
So, you make Carol Thatcher.

79
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,800
And now, how much preparation goes into, well, obviously, you put a nose on.

80
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
I did have a nose on.

81
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,800
But what else goes on preparing for Carol Thatcher?

82
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,800
I should make up some shit for them.

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I watched, I'm a celebrity, get me out of here.

84
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,800
But when you're playing it at something I could attempt, if you do, like for a broad church, did you do preparation?

85
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Sorry.

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
David did.

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,800
And I could ask him questions.

88
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It seems silly doubling up.

89
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,800
So, to defend my actions, I don't think my character spoke in the same sort of rhythms as detectives.

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,800
So I thought it'd be better if I didn't have that influence.

91
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Good answer.

92
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Do you doubt a lot though?

93
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Yes, thank you for saving me.

94
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,800
I do.

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
In that.

96
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,800
Well, Nick Frost is the lead guy.

97
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,800
And he, as a child, I'm his sister.

98
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
That's it.

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm his sister.

100
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I remember.

101
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,800
And as children, he was salsa champion and endless cups and awards and things.

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,800
And we used to go off and do competitions and I was his dance partner.

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
And then something happened.

104
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
And his life changed.

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
And salsa wasn't for him after that moment.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,800
And then, cut to Nick Frost present day.

107
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Or whatever his character's called.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
And Bruce.

109
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
He's called Bruce.

110
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
That's it.

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
I'm really good.

112
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,800
I got many people who are applauding you rememberingультат of people in your own film.

113
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,800
It was anètement bad.

114
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
We know this feeling.

115
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,800
You filmed something.

116
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Nelson Mandela.

117
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,800
Nelson Mandela.

118
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,800
You know you're not in big, you're not in big preparation, but you must have had some dancers.

119
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I was forced to because I had to dance on screen.

120
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
So I had to practice.

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Do you look good though?

122
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Well, there is, as you know, there are people who actually condense.

123
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Yeah.

124
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
Because I can only spend three times before I vomit.

125
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,800
We never picture of you in rehearsals where it doesn't look like it's going that well.

126
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
That's the best thing I've ever seen.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I also love that you're wearing like a full sweatsuit and heels.

128
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
What did you perform?

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
You performed at a seafood festival?

130
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,800
I mean, which shit show you want to know about?

131
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
That town don't know.

132
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It was only, I think they wanted, was it crap?

133
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
I had a crab fest.

134
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
Crab fest.

135
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,800
What is that?

136
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,800
And at the beginning of the stand-up comedy, you're not performing in luxury venues.

137
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Wherever they feel that they can build the stage and make money is where you're going.

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,800
So there was a crab fest.

139
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,800
We're going to book some talent.

140
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,800
A comedian talent.

141
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
That was like, oh, you know, I'm available.

142
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,800
I don't know if you guys have ever tried to tell a joke while people cracking crabs.

143
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,800
That's the best environment.

144
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Literally, the frustration that comes from not being able to open a crab is stupid.

145
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
But you're not funny at the same time.

146
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
I'm not for you here.

147
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,800
I remember hearing a woman, older lady, who was like, she was cracking crabs.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Because this is how you crack crab.

149
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Now I'm here, she's like cracking a crab.

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Now tell a joke and a joke doesn't work.

151
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Now remember this lady just going, oh no.

152
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I don't think I would much rather be booed.

153
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
This is a point.

154
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,800
From her voice.

155
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,800
She said, baby, it was like, oh no, baby.

156
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,800
And then I made a mistake with my choice of life.

157
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I'm not going wrong.

158
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,800
You know, look, the hardship that I went through has helped build me into the person I am today right.

159
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
I can take so much.

160
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
But I've been through it all.

161
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I was hitting the face with a buffalo wing.

162
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,800
I performed at a cat's house.

163
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,799
I'm going to show you now.

164
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,799
There's no food.

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,799
It was actually a male strip club that they shut down for comedy for the first half.

166
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,799
It was a bunch of ladies in there.

167
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,799
And you know, it was just supposed to be us performing for these women that were riled up.

168
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,799
First thing, I got on stage when they introduced me and his lady was like, pull it out.

169
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,799
I said, hey, hey.

170
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,799
Hey, that's not me.

171
00:08:57,799 --> 00:08:58,799
I'm not here.

172
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,799
I'm here to entertain.

173
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,799
He's a joke.

174
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,799
I know who's got kids.

175
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:06,799
I started trying to emerge into kid material.

176
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,799
And one dude from the back, I didn't remember his dude from the back.

177
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,799
He was like, that's enough.

178
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:14,799
And he just threw a buffalo wing at me.

179
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,799
And the man who hit me, hit me in the cheek,

180
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,799
a little bit of sauce, got like, right here.

181
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,799
Buffalo sauce is hot.

182
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,799
So I started.

183
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,799
I assumed it was a woman with a deep voice.

184
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:26,799
So I was like, who threw it?

185
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:27,799
Who threw it?

186
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,799
Because at the end of the day, I'm a man.

187
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,799
I'm a man first.

188
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:31,799
Don't just respect me.

189
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,799
He stood up.

190
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,799
He was like, I did it.

191
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:36,799
And I contemplated just taking my clothes off.

192
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,799
I was like, I said, I'm the only way to do that.
