1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Good, can I just say I heard all of those.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,500
We know.

3
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
We know.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,000
I feel red, right?

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Sup, Rory?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Dark people.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We are in America.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're cool.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We've got something very special for you.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
We have got a dad joke since all about America.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,500
And we are doing two teams.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
Whole crew Pat has picked his team.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,500
Team Pat.

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,500
I have picked my team.

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,000
And these are the rules.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Regular dad joke rules apply.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you laugh, you have to take a shot.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,500
But not only that, you also have to tag team out with one of your team members on the couch.

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Team with the most points at the end wins.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Let's go!

21
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
We are doing this for America.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,500
And I'm doing this for England.

23
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,500
We are doing this for England.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
This is my rock.

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,500
This is my rock.

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
This is my rock.

27
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
This is my rock.

28
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,500
This is my rock.

29
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,500
This is my rock.

30
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,500
Who are the hardest working Americans who are they?

31
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Mexicans.

32
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Okay.

33
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Aye aye aye.

34
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Not laughing at this one.

35
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
I'm not going to tag down.

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
What's the worst band in America?

37
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
What?

38
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
I don't know if you've heard of them.

39
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
They have a song that goes boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Is it a tally band?

41
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,500
There's a quiver.

42
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Is it my Spotify rap?

43
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
What are you the second time?

44
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Oh god.

45
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Oh god.

46
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
You know one day I would love to visit the Grand Canyon.

47
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Side note, Peyton hates it when I call it the John of the Grand Canyon.

48
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,500
She's so good team.

49
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
Oh my god.

50
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,500
You're going to go team and get out.

51
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Dead for me.

52
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Dead for me.

53
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Dead for me.

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Dead for me.

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Dead for me.

56
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,500
What the fuck out of you, Pat?

57
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Jesus.

58
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
You're a new-roa vendory.

59
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
You're a real poly.

60
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
You're a real poly.

61
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
It's got to be my team.

62
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
It's got to be my team.

63
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
It's got to be my team.

64
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
I'll let you go first.

65
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,500
Thank you.

66
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Well since Pat was talking about the Grand Canyon,

67
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,500
I've actually booked a helicopter ride through the Grand Canyon.

68
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Yeah?

69
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Yeah, yeah.

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
I thought that was a big doubt.

71
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
I thought he was about to go through Peyton's vagina.

72
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,500
And on your left, there's Peyton's vagina.

73
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,500
I do, guys.

74
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
It's very tight.

75
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Hi.

76
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
On this team we have Tyler John.

77
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Here we go.

78
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Here we go.

79
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Some people think that the biggest handprints in Hollywood

80
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
are up the Chinese team.

81
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,500
But they're actually on Justin Bieber's house and it's P Diddy's hand.

82
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Baby, baby, baby, baby.

83
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,500
No!

84
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,500
Oh, when I was 13.

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
I was 13.

86
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,500
I had my first love.

87
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I told him these ones in there.

88
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I want a couple more before I get out of the car.

89
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

90
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

91
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

92
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,500
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

93
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'm going to get a little bit of a ride.

94
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
I want a couple more before I get out of this bitch.

95
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,500
Sorry, team.

96
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,500
That's all right.

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
You got a pain.

98
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Peyton's been talking about how she's brought all these jokes today.

99
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,500
So I'm very excited to hear these.

100
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
I'm so smart.

101
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Okay, let's go.

102
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,500
Seriously, all right.

103
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
So I got my friend some baby all the other day and I went,

104
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
shit, did it?

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,500
That's pretty good.

106
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,500
That's pretty good.

107
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,500
That's pretty good.

108
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,500
That's crazy stuff.

109
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,500
That's really good.

110
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Simone Biles is the only black woman in America when they say,

111
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
put your hands up.

112
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
She goes,

113
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I can't.

114
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
The mind games are unreal.

115
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,500
What do you pull an ti American guy in debt?

116
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Trump.

117
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
I mean like ew, I would never call him.

118
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,500
That's our girl.

119
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,500
That was a little giggle shortly before.

120
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,500
That was a giggle for you.

121
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
You're a good girl.

122
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Yeah.

123
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Okay, so you're also a hilarious lady.

124
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
Slay, slay, slay, slay.

125
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,500
How you feeling?

126
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Good.

127
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Do you want to go first when we do another one?

128
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
No, I'll go.

129
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Challenge, challenge, challenge, challenge, challenge, challenge.

130
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Okay.

131
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Okay, so the new quiet place movie came out.

132
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
But it's not a horror film.

133
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
It's the ditty tapes.

134
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Ditty is getting roasted.

135
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,500
And he deserves it.

136
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
Fuck, ditty.

137
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Those self-driving cars in LA,

138
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,500
they actually remind me of Matt's brain on the mind out.

139
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Because you know like the lights are off but nobody's home.

140
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,500
She's on the routine.

141
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I love you Matt.

142
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,500
It's true.

143
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,500
You seem as only raw jokes about themselves.

144
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
We're out the other night.

145
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,500
I saw these two homeless transvestites arguing on the street.

146
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I bet you had the better outfit.

147
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,500
So I went over to them and said,

148
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,500
Timmy and Matt, you're both so beautiful.

149
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,500
I'm so messed up.

150
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
I'm so much.

151
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,500
What's the difference between American dad jokes

152
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
and Australian dad jokes?

153
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I mean one country baller pull a gun at you if they get offended.

154
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,500
You.

155
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,500
That's a lot.

156
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,500
That's a lot.

157
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
That's so bad.

158
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,500
That was so bad.

159
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500
That was so bad.

160
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,500
That was so bad.

161
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
We did it together.

162
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,500
Can we come in with this ball?

163
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,500
These guys have been cane for these balls.

164
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Yeah.

165
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,500
Apparently they're really going.

166
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,500
So they're going to make it snappy, huh?

167
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I bet can I just say I heard all of those.

168
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
We know.

169
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
We know.

170
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm going to wear this.

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Cheers, guys.

172
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Cheers.

173
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Nice on girls.

174
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Timmy got Matt debut.

175
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Wow.

176
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Timmy got Matt debut.

177
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
You're all fair now.

178
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Good to see you.

179
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
There we go.

180
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
This is the table, dude.

181
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
What do you think?

182
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
It's quite nice.

183
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
First time in.

184
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
It's like a knee toe.

185
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
The couch is all the way over there.

186
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
That's where I belong.

187
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Alright, let's send you back.

188
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Did you guys?

189
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
You're boxing.

190
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
You're holding on.

191
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
You're boxing.

192
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
You're boxing.

193
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,500
You're boxing.

194
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
You're just going to pull the decide.

195
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Until I can't say America.

196
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Yeah, you've been riding them.

197
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
To be a lot.

198
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,500
He's a fuck out of him, right?

199
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
Get on the wheel.

200
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Bill, he's good.

201
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,500
Get on the wheel.

202
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Get on the wheel.

203
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Get on the wheel.

204
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,500
That's the shortest debut on the table.

205
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Hi.

206
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Hi.

207
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
It was good while it lasted.

208
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
It was great.

209
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
You're going to give it up here.

210
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
It was awesome.

211
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I think that's what I'm saying.

212
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Oh, the final last one.

213
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,500
What do you call the area between a California women's boobs?

214
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
What?

215
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Silicon Valley.

216
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,500
What?

217
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
What?

218
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Silicon Valley.

219
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,500
What?

220
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
What?

221
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
What?

222
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,500
I did that.

223
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
That's a great thing.

224
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,500
We did a card battle out without saying anything.

225
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Give it to get.

226
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
Let's rock it fuel.

227
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Straight out rock it fuel.

228
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,500
We should go to cheese for both of you.

229
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
Jesus Christ.

230
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Let's rock it fuel.

231
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Jesus Christ.

232
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Where are you going?

233
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
Slip in slides.

234
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Hell.

235
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Let's do that again.

236
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
Let's do that again.

237
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Let's do that again.

238
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,500
Slip in slides.

239
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Fun for everyone.

240
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,500
Except Justin Bieber.

241
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,500
He gets PTSDD.

242
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Oh.

243
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,500
What?

244
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
What?

245
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
What?

246
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,500
What?

247
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
What?

248
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,500
What?

249
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
What?

250
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
What?

251
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,500
What?

252
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
No cap.

253
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
No cap.

254
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
What?

255
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
You don't know what daddy eats.

256
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
The Mayvatch time?

257
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
No.

258
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
No.

259
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Matt laughed.

260
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Oh, that's a big one.

261
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Hang on, sorry. Can I just, uh, how does it feel?

262
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:18,700
What? Me interrupting you.

263
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,299
That's the joke of the day.

264
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:24,700
Did he use laugh?

265
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,500
I smiled.

266
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,700
It's smiling, smiling.

267
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:27,700
I think he did.

268
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,700
I swear to God, I smiled.

269
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
Thank you very much.

270
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Okay.

271
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,299
You can interrupt all you want.

272
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,100
What's the similarity between Ian and every product in America?

273
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,899
They're all from China.

274
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Made in China.

275
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Okay.

276
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,300
Sun of it.

277
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,500
Try a random joke that's not easy to fucking figure out.

278
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:49,700
Horrible.

279
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
Horrible.

280
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,700
Restaurant.

281
00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:54,500
In America is five guys.

282
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,899
Which is also how he lost his virginity.

284
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,100
Do you see that dribbles run out of it?

285
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,100
You're pretty pretty pretty.

286
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,299
You're saying five guys.

287
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:18,100
Oh, man.

288
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:20,299
That was good, but you fuck off.

289
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,299
There you go.

290
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,699
How?

291
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:32,299
I've been seeing these robot delivery food things in America.

292
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,299
Yeah.

293
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:35,299
In Australia, we just call them Indians.

294
00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:42,299
What's going on?

295
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:43,699
Oh, damn it.

296
00:11:43,699 --> 00:11:45,100
Oh, my gosh.

297
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
Yeah.

298
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
Just stare him down.

299
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Oh, he got me staring down.

300
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
That was a great joke.

301
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
That was a great joke.

302
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,100
It was either that or caught sass.

303
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,500
Which one do you want to eat those?

304
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,100
That little bottle.

305
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,299
Do you have any of this?

306
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:00,299
Yeah, I have any.

307
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:01,299
Oh, Jesus.

308
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:02,299
Have some.

309
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:03,299
I'll have some.

310
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:04,299
I'll have some.

311
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:05,299
Yeah.

312
00:12:05,299 --> 00:12:06,299
Yeah, that's nice.

313
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,299
Good one, Ian.

314
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,299
I like that one.

315
00:12:08,299 --> 00:12:09,299
Nice one, Ian.

316
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:10,299
All right, that one.

317
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:11,299
Yeah.

318
00:12:11,299 --> 00:12:13,299
That's my guy.

319
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:14,299
That's my guy.

320
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,299
No pain now.

321
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:16,299
No pain.

322
00:12:16,299 --> 00:12:17,299
Fuck him up.

323
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:18,299
Go, go, go.

324
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:19,299
Go, go.

325
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:20,299
Go, go, go, go.

326
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:21,299
Go, go, go.

327
00:12:21,299 --> 00:12:23,299
I didn't know we were in a timeless whiff concept.

328
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:24,299
Stare it down.

329
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:27,099
Ah, I like it.

330
00:12:27,099 --> 00:12:30,099
I love Americans.

331
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,099
Good one.

332
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,099
That's the joke.

333
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:35,099
That's the joke.

334
00:12:35,099 --> 00:12:36,099
Oh, right.

335
00:12:36,099 --> 00:12:38,099
Stop riding your joke, man.

336
00:12:38,099 --> 00:12:40,099
I like it.

337
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:41,099
Come on, Ian.

338
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:44,099
And steal him like the rest of us.

339
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:47,099
No, don't be telling jokes.

340
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,099
I like it.

341
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,099
I like it.

342
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:50,099
I like it.

343
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:51,099
I like it.

344
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:52,099
I like it.

345
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,099
I like it.

346
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,100
No, no, no.

347
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me.

348
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,100
That was the joke.

349
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,100
You know what I was saying?

350
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,100
You say?

351
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,100
Let me go out here.

352
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,100
I got pulled up by customs at the airport.

353
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
Uh-huh.

354
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Surprise, surprise.

355
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,100
Always.

356
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,100
I looked like I have drugs on me.

357
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,500
And the guy was like, I need to see your papers.

358
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
I need to see your passport.

359
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
I have some questions.

360
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,300
And I was like, I have some questions.

361
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Aren't you Mexican?

362
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,899
Shouldn't you just be like, underly, underly, underly,

363
00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:18,899
get in here, brother.

364
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,300
I've had a Mexican work on the American borders.

365
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,299
I was like, having a Jew work at Auschwitz.

366
00:13:23,299 --> 00:13:26,299
Oh, big.

367
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,299
She's surprised me.

368
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,299
I mean, that joke was longer than our fight.

370
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:35,299
Oh, my God.

371
00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:37,299
Oh, my God.

372
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:39,299
That's my team member.

373
00:13:39,299 --> 00:13:41,299
That was a great, great.

374
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:42,299
I'm so good.

375
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:43,299
Hello, my man.

376
00:13:43,299 --> 00:13:45,299
Very full-ean.

377
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:49,299
So, Jor, Jor, next, tell me which other country you love.

378
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:53,299
OK, what do you call an atomic bomb in Hawaii?

379
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,299
What?

380
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:56,299
An ukulele.

382
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:01,299
That's so good.

383
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,299
They're all dead.

384
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:05,299
They're all dead.

385
00:14:05,299 --> 00:14:07,299
A ukulele.

386
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:09,299
A ukulele.

387
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:11,299
A ukulele.

388
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,299
A ukulele.

389
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:15,299
I've ever seen a lacrosse.

390
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:17,299
Like, lacrosse.

391
00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:18,299
What's up?

392
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:21,299
Like, the American spot across.

393
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,299
It's a lot of muscle that gets wasted.

394
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,299
I haven't seen that much wasted muscle since I looked at Michael J. Fox.

395
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,299
Oh!

396
00:14:34,299 --> 00:14:36,299
Oh!

397
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:37,299
You're gonna be crying.

398
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,299
I love foxes.

399
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,299
They're so cute.

401
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,299
OK, OK, OK.

402
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:46,299
Why was the American wolf less than a wolf?

403
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:49,299
Why was the American wolf way down upset?

405
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:52,299
Because he only got 50% of the chip.

407
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:58,299
Hey, you know what I love?

408
00:14:58,299 --> 00:15:00,299
But I wrote that, so...

409
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,299
Hey!

410
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:04,299
We're in this car!

411
00:15:04,299 --> 00:15:06,299
That's a cracker.

412
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,299
I like it.

413
00:15:08,299 --> 00:15:10,299
I'll try one with you.

414
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:12,299
Yeah, let's have a buzz ball.

415
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:14,299
You have a rag on there.

416
00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:16,299
I'm gonna try it.

417
00:15:16,299 --> 00:15:18,299
I'm gonna try it.

418
00:15:18,299 --> 00:15:20,299
I'm gonna try it.

419
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:22,299
Oh!

420
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:24,299
No!

421
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:26,299
Oh!

422
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:28,299
You want to try it?

423
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,299
I don't believe this dude.

424
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,299
Let me try it.

425
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:36,299
Yeah, I mean, it honestly looks like a night out with Pat.

426
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:38,299
That's not very nice.

427
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,299
Like a night out with Pat.

428
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:42,299
OK, OK, OK.

429
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:44,299
OK.

430
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:46,299
The...

431
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,299
It's correct, then, I guess.

432
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:50,299
Oh, OK.

433
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:52,299
OK, that was it.

434
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:54,299
Let's get to the moving underlay.

435
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:56,299
Oh, mate.

436
00:15:56,299 --> 00:15:58,299
Oh, mate, go on, buddy.

437
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:00,299
Oh, boys, I'm back.

438
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:02,299
I'm gonna have a pre-shot joke.

439
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:04,299
To pre-shot joke? Yeah, sure.

440
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:06,299
Oh, yeah, go for it.

441
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,299
Oh, yeah, no.

442
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:10,299
I'll have that.

443
00:16:10,299 --> 00:16:12,299
Timmy, Timmy, joke off of that one.

444
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:14,299
I won't warn you.

445
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,299
I'm gonna ask you.

446
00:16:16,299 --> 00:16:18,299
Who's the worst in America right now?

447
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:20,299
Marie.

448
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,299
Oh, shit.

449
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:26,299
It's actually Peyton Faru and in that joke.

450
00:16:26,299 --> 00:16:28,299
Oh, no!

451
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,299
I'm sorry!

452
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:32,299
I'm not giving a different thought.

453
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,299
Don't laugh.

454
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,299
Keep it together.

455
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,299
Keep it together.

456
00:16:38,299 --> 00:16:40,299
Hello.

457
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:44,299
I've got one for you.

458
00:16:44,299 --> 00:16:48,299
Funny thing is, I wrote a few of Matt's jokes today,

459
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,299
so I'm gonna tell him one of the ones that I gave him.

460
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:54,299
I went down on a UFC girl the other day.

461
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:56,299
Good job.

462
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:58,299
Yeah.

463
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:00,299
I've put in not me out.

464
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,299
Ultimate fishy shit.

465
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:06,299
Oh, my God.

466
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:10,299
Hey, Rory.

467
00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:14,299
I went down on a UFC fight in the other day.

468
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:22,299
They're pussy knocked me out.

469
00:17:22,299 --> 00:17:24,299
Ultimate fishy shit.

470
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:28,299
Get it!

471
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:32,299
Hey, I only do one Matt.

472
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:36,299
You told that delivery.

473
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:40,299
That's a man you wrote that does suit.

474
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:44,299
Yeah, I just write that one.

475
00:17:44,299 --> 00:17:48,299
You're the hot fan.

476
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,299
I'm hot!

477
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:52,299
I'm hot!

478
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:54,299
You're hot!

479
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,299
You're hot!

480
00:17:56,299 --> 00:17:58,299
You're hot!

481
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:00,299
You're hot!

482
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:02,299
I'm hot.

483
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:04,299
Hello.

484
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:06,299
Pleasure.

485
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:08,299
Why are Americans good at Rubik's jokes?

486
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,299
Why?

487
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:14,299
Because they have a history of separating colors.

488
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,299
Oh, yeah.

489
00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:18,299
Oh, you're hot.

490
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,299
I'm gonna do it.

491
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,299
I'm gonna do it.

492
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:28,299
I'm gonna do it.

493
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:30,299
Oh, my God.

494
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:32,299
I tried so hard not to laugh at that.

495
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:34,299
That was insane.

496
00:18:34,299 --> 00:18:36,299
I can hear you.

497
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,299
Cheers.

498
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:40,299
Learn how to say it.

499
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:42,299
Timmy.

500
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,299
Timmy.

501
00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:46,299
Timmy, you can win this.

502
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,299
It's your debut.

503
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:52,299
Two fat chicks were next to me in a local convenience store.

504
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,299
One dropped a bag of jolly rogers.

505
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,299
Ranchers.

506
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,299
I've never watched a funny game of hungry hippos.

507
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,299
Oh, my God.

508
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,299
That's hilarious.

509
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:08,299
Don't laugh, Timmy.

510
00:19:08,299 --> 00:19:10,299
Don't laugh, Timmy.

511
00:19:10,299 --> 00:19:12,299
Don't laugh.

512
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:14,299
He doesn't get it.

513
00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:16,299
He doesn't get it.

514
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:18,299
He got this.

515
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:20,299
That was funny, Timmy.

516
00:19:20,299 --> 00:19:22,299
Timmy, that was...

517
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,299
That was good.

518
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:26,299
We can tell you don't know what a jolly rancher is.

519
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,299
No, I don't.

520
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:30,299
No, I don't.

521
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,299
That's not what I'm saying.

522
00:19:32,299 --> 00:19:36,299
So there's a prostitute problem in LA.

523
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:38,299
Yeah, the problem.

524
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:42,299
The problem is, they say no to me.

525
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,299
The smell is roast.

526
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:48,299
The smell is roast.

527
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:50,299
Yeah, Timmy.

528
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,299
Hold me together, then.

529
00:19:52,299 --> 00:19:53,299
Let him out.

530
00:19:53,299 --> 00:20:01,299
He's a good, new, racist, shameless, finish up.

531
00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:03,299
What are we doing, short, listen?

532
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:05,299
Me and Casey.

533
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,299
When you go to say this thing,

534
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:09,299
you need such a good joke to me.

535
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,299
This is so hard.

536
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,299
You laugh to let it out.

537
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:15,299
Yeah, well, like, get him out.

538
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,299
Get him out.

539
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,299
Get him out.

540
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:21,299
Get him out.

541
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:23,299
It's just Timmy with tits.

542
00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:25,299
Get him out.

543
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:27,299
You see this then?

544
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,299
And cut 20.

545
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,299
Bring it on.

546
00:20:31,299 --> 00:20:33,299
Bring it on, Sass.

547
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,299
Bring it on, dude.

548
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,299
You got it.

549
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:39,299
Oh, no, you got it.

550
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,299
You're the newbie today.

551
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:45,299
Uh, George Washington, that probably had wooden teeth,

552
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,299
which made it really hard when he ate the beaver.

553
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:51,299
Oh, I'm sorry.

554
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,299
I'm sorry, man.

555
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:55,299
Dude, that was fine.

556
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,299
Get over here.

557
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,299
You got it.

558
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,299
You got it.

559
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,299
Thank you.

560
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:05,299
You utilized it.

561
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,299
You were easy.

562
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,299
Oh, you said it.

563
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,299
Oh, you said it.

564
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:13,299
I said it.

565
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:15,299
I said it.

566
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,299
Sorry, man.

567
00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:19,299
Dude, that was fine.
