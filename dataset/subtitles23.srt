1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm gonna be honest.

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,800
I nearly threw up.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,799
LAUGHTER

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:07,799
I'm gonna do it.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Pops, hop, pop!

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,400
Ho-ee!

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,000
Pop!

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yeah, very good.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
It's fair, good, fair to us.

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,600
Payton, how about now?

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm good, how you're?

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,600
I am thirsty.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,399
I'm thirsty too, but not as thirsty as you always.

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,399
What is that supposed to mean?

15
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:39,000
I can't find out.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's trying to hide his erection.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
OK, should we...

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
...do it as his...

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, you...

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yes, sure.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Would you just want to go first?

22
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
No.

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
See you, sirs.

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Pay for a rock.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
See you, sirs.

26
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Pay for a rock.

27
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
See you, sirs.

28
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Pay for a rock.

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,400
Oh!

30
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
You can kick-sad us.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You can kick-sad us.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,600
Um...

33
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,600
So, might say, sir, I stole my cow the other day.

34
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:08,600
And I said it's all good.

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,600
It was just a bit of a case of mistaken identity.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He's a good star.

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
He's a good star.

38
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
He's a good star.

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
What?

40
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh, shit.

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,400
Fuck, OK.

42
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
Oh no.

43
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,599
OK, well, cheers to my funny joke.

44
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,599
Cheers to you.

45
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,599
Um...

46
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Um, Mexican magician...

47
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,599
...saying he could disappear by counting to three.

48
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,599
Who knows?

49
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,599
Poo!

50
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:44,599
He disappeared.

51
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:46,599
He was gone without a trace.

52
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,599
Ch-chase.

53
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,599
I was so mad.

54
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:54,599
One of those trace.

55
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:56,599
Who knows?

56
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:57,599
That is...

57
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:58,599
That is trace.

58
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,599
Fuck.

59
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:01,599
Fuck.

60
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,599
Why is he so big Spanish?

61
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,599
I'm not gonna lie.

62
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:06,599
I was like...

63
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,599
Is this how you pronounce it?

64
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,599
The most fuzzy way to do that is all my life.

65
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,599
Trice.

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:14,599
And a rustic...

67
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:15,599
Trice?

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,599
I can't get out of this.

69
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,599
All right, lunch.

70
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:19,599
I'll have to eat that ice.

71
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,599
Yeah.

72
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,599
Oh.

73
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,599
What's the matter, Saf? You're allergic to good jokes.

74
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,599
I just rocked up, like, but it's still waking up.

75
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,599
Look at it. It's all cozy there.

76
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:33,599
Anyway, shh.

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,599
OK, my old high school teacher told me I'd be terrible at poetry

78
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,599
due to my dyslexia.

79
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,599
But it's so crazy, because I've already made like two vases,

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,599
two jugs and a nash tray.

81
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:52,599
It took me, it took me a saver down there.

82
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:53,599
I'm not even saying that he doesn't get it.

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,599
But it's back to the bed.

84
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:57,599
My pottery, right?

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,599
Yeah?

86
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:02,599
Sweet, we did it out, I just wanted to make sure.

87
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,599
But it's...

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,599
Thanks, Kat.

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,599
It doesn't count.

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,599
OK.

91
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:10,599
I punched one of the seven dwarves.

92
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,599
No, I didn't.

93
00:03:20,599 --> 00:03:21,599
Ah!

94
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,599
I'm scared, I was all right. Hang on, wait, wait.

95
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,599
All right, so I'm in the drug and then we'll drink.

96
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,599
I...

97
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:34,599
I punched one of the seven dwarves.

98
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,599
Yeah.

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,599
It wasn't happy.

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,599
Why was it so much funnier when you just said you punched someone?

101
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,599
I don't know, I hit it with the...

102
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,599
You're not touching down.

103
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,599
LAUGHTER

104
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,599
OK.

105
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,599
So why wouldn't they let the dog in the UFC?

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
Because his bark was worse than his bite.

107
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,599
Everyone's like, I didn't kill it.

108
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,599
I don't think I could...

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,599
No, I didn't.

110
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:07,599
I don't think I could.

111
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,599
OK, so the silence was just...

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,599
It's bad.

113
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:13,599
I was telling you, what's the reason I thought I was in this game

114
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,599
because I don't laugh, Rory.

115
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,600
Hey, Peyton, you heard a hot girl summer?

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Have I ever?

117
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
We'll get ready for smooth sacs summer, baby.

118
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
That's right, you hear it, McLeary's.

119
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
It's time to whack those sacs back into shape.

120
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,600
And what a better way to do that than with the men's scape of former's package,

You're going like a two-point-o?

Wow.

149
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,600
How many Mexicans does it take to screw in a light bulb?

150
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Dressed.

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Dressed.

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Just one.

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
not just one.

154
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Not just one.

155
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Not just one.

156
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Not just one.

157
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
Not just one.

158
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Not just one.

159
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Not just one.

160
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Right.

161
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
Fuck.

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Fuck.

163
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,600
What does a piece of delivery man in a gynecologist

164
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,600
have in common?

165
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,600
They both can scrape some cheese off the box for a quick snack.

166
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Oh, fuck.

167
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm vous.

168
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Fuck.

169
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
No, that's.

170
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
That's it.

171
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
Too early.

172
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Too early.

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Too early.

174
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,600
I guess Sylweth got it, that's it.

175
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,600
I get so excited, don't you?

176
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Shut the fuck up, bro, are you a day for art?

177
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's for sure.

178
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,600
I'm not to talk to someone in private, but I'm...

179
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,600
Sorry.

180
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,600
What's one thing women always support?

181
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,600
Going.

182
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
A man's right to shut the fuck up.

183
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh, you...

184
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Oh, man, hands right to shut the fuck up.

185
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
You know something came with a back set.

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Something popped up right set, you say?

187
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I don't talk to say that.

188
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
Have you seen the movie about a little fish with cancer?

189
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Finding chemo.

190
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
I had that so bad!

191
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
A little fishy.

192
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Holy hell.

193
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
You grew up a shot.

194
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
Fish out, friends. Bad dead.

195
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Cheers. Cheers to the fish.

196
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Cheers to the...

197
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
Cheers to the little chemo.

198
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,600
How do you make an idiot say how?

199
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
How?

200
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Oh, my eyes are like...

201
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
My heart's racing.

202
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
That's what I feel like.

203
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Hey, hey.

204
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,600
You're a fucking idiot.

205
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,600
That's the opposite.

206
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Point of case.

207
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
Fuck.

208
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
That was great.

209
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,600
Okay, class members say what?

210
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Okay, sorry.

211
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
All right, all right.

212
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,600
I just want to let the record show...

213
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I did not laugh at that one.

214
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
No, I thought that was a pretty average.

215
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
What did you...

216
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Did you not get it?

217
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
That was so great!

218
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Yeah, you held that so well.

219
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I was so surprised.

220
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I was like, Matt will lose his mind.

221
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Well, to be fair, the instant regret was instant.

222
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
How about this?

223
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Hey, Peyton.

224
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Hey.

225
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
Why aren't blots?

226
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Hey, it's the real blot here.

227
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Come on.

228
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Why aren't blons good cattle herders?

229
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
Why?

230
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
They can't keep...

231
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
Fuck, I'm pissed.

232
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Wait, what's that?

233
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You're too huge.

234
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
We're going to take another show of that.

235
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Thanks, Ben.

236
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
Hey, Peyton.

237
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Why aren't blons good cattle herders?

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
Why?

239
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,600
Because they can't even keep two calves together.

240
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
I don't get it.

241
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,600
Like the legs?

242
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Two calves.

243
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Not together.

244
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Matt!

245
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
I did that.

246
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I did that.

247
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I did that.

248
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Continue.

249
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
All right.

250
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I hate when people joke about the Holocaust.

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,600
And frankly, I won't stand for it.

252
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
That's right, I'm not even going to live.

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,600
God, he's good.

254
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
There was like an inaudible...

255
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,600
Stop, stop.

256
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,600
Okay, thank you.

257
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
What the hell?

258
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Have you hit the real mat in the attic?

259
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
What do you call...

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
What do you call...

261
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
What do you call...

262
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,600
Sorry.

263
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,600
What do you call Winnie the Pooh's grandmother?

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I don't know.

265
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Poonernie.

266
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
I was just waiting for one, Benjol.

267
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I was just...

268
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Poonernie.

269
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
I have a Winnie the Pooh.

270
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I was just saying this.

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,600
I have a Winnie the Pooh little...

272
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
I have a Winnie the Pooh little...

273
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,600
I have a Winnie the Pooh little...

274
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
Come on!

275
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Oh, shit.

276
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
Chess.

277
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,600
It's a very fun part.

278
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Put the bananas to put on this.

279
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,600
And then he's...

280
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,600
Cheers.

281
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
How are you?

282
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Knock knock.

283
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,600
Who's there?

284
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
And Frank, shut the fuck up.

285
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
I feel like...

286
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
But she has not got a mouth like...

287
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Who on earth said it again?

288
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Hey, knock knock.

289
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Who's...

290
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Eo.

291
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Eo who?

292
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I'm an Eo your ass to that.

293
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
What the hell are you doing?

294
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,600
I'm so sorry about that fucking party.

295
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Holy shit!

296
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm sorry, but that was fun.

297
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm sorry.

298
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Did you hear about the toy who caught public transport?

299
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,600
No.

300
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
It was bus like you.

301
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,600
What type of bus crossed the ocean?

302
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
What?

303
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Columbus.

304
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Columbus.

305
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
That's... that's it. That's still the bus, boss.

306
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Fuck!

307
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Oh my god, hang on.

308
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,600
We just couple of people having a little bit of fun on the set out.

309
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,600
A little bit of bus fun.

310
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Piggy bus fun.

311
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Cheers.

312
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Go, bus girl.

313
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,600
Go, bus girl.

314
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Go, bus girl.

315
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
This bus girl, baby.

316
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
Hang bus.

317
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,600
We just wait for the background.

318
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Come, come, did...

319
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,600
What did Helen Kellaget for Christmas?

320
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Nothing. She had everything.

321
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Okay.

322
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Do you know who Helen Kellaget is?

323
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,600
No idea.

324
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
Helen Kellaget is deaf, dumb and blind.

325
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,600
Is Kat turning into me? Like, just hang on.

326
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
That's my job.

327
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Oh my god, we got more?

328
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Oh my god.

329
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
Oh, shit.

330
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh my god.

331
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Oh my god.

332
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Oh my god.

333
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Here you keep a blonde busy.

334
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
What?

335
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
A blonde busy.

336
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,600
What?

337
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Fuck yeah.

338
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
I can't even know what it was.

339
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
I was like, what the hell is going on?

340
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,600
It's very artistic comedy.

341
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll just give it a shot.

342
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
You don't know how to play a boy.

343
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
You don't know how to play a boy.

344
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
It's a story with you, baby.

345
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,600
Are you ready?

346
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,600
It's a punani.

347
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,600
What do you call a bunch of white guys standing in the line?

348
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
The new cast of Yamat.

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,600
You're all white.

350
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,600
You're all right.

351
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,600
I mean, I've got to go.

352
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,600
I said, I said, I got to go.

353
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Right, that's your first fucking warning.

354
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
That's your first warning.

355
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Anyone know that?

356
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
You're done.

357
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Right?

358
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
I was born in Germany.

359
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
I'm sorry.

360
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
You're just winning.

361
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Do you know what that is now?

362
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
I can't.

363
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
I'm okay.

364
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
I'm okay.

365
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Just...

366
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
This is why people hate you back.

367
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
So necessary, you've ruined it.

368
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
What kind of STDs do fish get?

369
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600
I don't know.

370
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,600
Clam media.

371
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,600
They also can get...

372
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,600
Hepatitis C...

373
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,600
...and also, murm aids.

374
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Um...

375
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,600
You having fun?

376
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,600
I have having fun.

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
You having fun?

378
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Fuck you, man.

379
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Fuck you, let's go.

380
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Let's go.

381
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,600
Let's go.

382
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Take two more, that one.

383
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Being more genuine.

384
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
That's really...

385
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,600
Okay, so what's white and always outside my window?

386
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Path.

387
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Is that a wrap? Is that a fucking wrap?

388
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Siss it out of your boys and girls, that says, get us a kiss.

389
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,600
One, the hell was smart and straight out of nowhere too.

390
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I didn't realize you could see me.

391
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
Sorry.

392
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
It's like this beach was over there.

393
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
It's on me now, Pat.

394
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
Four times.

395
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Four times. We all hear the punchline.

396
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
Okay, that was a lot.

397
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
It was gonna be Matt.

398
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
He couldn't see over the bridge.

399
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Rock him, fucking. See you right now.

400
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Oh, wow.

401
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Look at TV. Do earthquake.

402
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Man, that goes down as my favourite moment on you, Matt.

403
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
It felt ever...

404
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
It's like, it's snappy, like, good to me to do it.

405
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,600
And then he comes on and gives the worst, best performance ever.

406
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Oh my god.

407
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Anyway, back to the game.

408
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Hey, Payton.

409
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Hey, what?

410
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,600
What was Tigger in...

411
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
What was...

412
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
I could talk about you saying Tigger.

413
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Yeah.

414
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Let's start that again.

415
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Hey, Payton.

416
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Hey, what?

417
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Why was Tigger in the bathroom for so long?

418
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
He was jumping.

419
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
He is the only one.

420
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
What?

421
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
He's jumping.

422
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Tigger like, bang, bang, bang.

423
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Can I get you this fucking taking a poo?

424
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
No, don't make them sexual, please.

425
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,599
Sexual poo.

426
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
What is this taking a sh**?

427
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,599
What the f**k?

428
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,599
No.

429
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,599
What's that you mean? I'm creating some buskets.

430
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,599
Don't.

431
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,599
Payton is jumping, though.

432
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,599
So that's what we're doing.

433
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,599
We're only one girl and one couple away from a fantasy completed.

434
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,599
Hey, what do you call a man who loves little bicycles?

435
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:38,599
Teenie tiny?

436
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,599
A petal file.

437
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:46,599
Think that.

438
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,599
Oh, okay.

439
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,599
Um.

440
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:52,599
It's such a silly thing.

441
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,599
My boyfriend said fucking joke.

442
00:17:57,599 --> 00:17:58,599
Oh, love, fucking.

443
00:17:58,599 --> 00:17:59,599
You did love.

444
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,599
I did not love.

445
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,599
Bra.

446
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,599
I know.

447
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,599
Do you know what the past is living animal on earth is?

448
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:06,599
Sorry.

449
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,599
Do you know what the fastest living animal on earth is?

450
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,599
Fast living animal on earth is.

451
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:12,599
It's an Ethiopian chicken.

452
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,599
Why?

453
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,599
Look, Payton, you had a great run.

454
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:30,599
I'm sorry.

455
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,599
It's so much rubbish.

456
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,599
How do you motivate a slow female rabbit?

457
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,599
I know.

458
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,599
Energize her batteries.

459
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,599
Is that meant to be funny?

460
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,599
That's terrible, but you face this a lot.

461
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,599
I'm gonna be honest.

462
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,599
I nearly threw up.

463
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:56,599
Are you okay?

464
00:18:56,599 --> 00:18:58,599
A little splat?

465
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:00,599
No, I'm sorry.

466
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:02,599
I'm a little...

467
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,599
Bra.

468
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,599
Okay, what?

469
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:07,599
Take healers now.

470
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:08,599
Good for you, man.

471
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,599
Try not to laugh, man.

472
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,599
Try not to laugh.

473
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,599
You're...

474
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,599
No, no, no, no.

475
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,599
I'm sorry.

476
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,599
What is Osama Bin Laden's favourite football team?

477
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,599
Tell me.

478
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,599
The New York Jets.

479
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:38,599
I'm a fucking idiot.

480
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,599
Man, I just...

481
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:43,599
Fuck, it's always hit twice, you know what I mean.

482
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:47,599
Fuck, that's bad.

483
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:48,599
I know.

484
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:49,599
It is what it is.

485
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,599
We should have a look at it.

486
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,599
This is so bad.

487
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,599
Hey, welcome.

488
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,599
Go Payton!

489
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,599
Go Payton!

490
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,599
Go Payton!

491
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:03,599
You're the show.

492
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,599
I got one more.

493
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:08,599
What is it, too?

494
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,599
I punch at the wall.

495
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,599
A.
