1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I forgot you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
As Thomas, I think a lot of youngers, they revere you,

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
so they look to you.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
But the other thing you inspire is impressions,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
people doing impressions.

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Now, when people do impressions of you,

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is it like nails on a chalkboard or do you kind of enjoy it?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
No, I kind of enjoy it, especially if they do it well.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
So, no, it's great.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I love it.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I only ask.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
No, because any hiddleston is watching will know.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Tom Hiddleston does impressions.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You do rock pressure lots of people.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, who is in your canon?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's an expression of admiration to be clear.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So, I do impressions of people that I admire,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and I sort of listen to them.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I get the first time I did an impression that anyone was aware of.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I was just telling a story about Midnight in Paris,

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the Woody Allen film I was in,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and how I never had the whole script,

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and I thought it was set in the 20s.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And I turned up, and I bonded to Owen Wilson,

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
who didn't look like he was in the 20s at all.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And I said to him, I said,

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
so wait, how on who you playing?

28
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Because I'm playing F-Scope Fitzgerald,

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and I know Corey Stolves playing on his hemming way,

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and we're all playing figures of history,

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and he went, oh, no, no, no, no.

32
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm from now.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I go back and play.

34
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
There's a time machine.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It's kind of cool, and it's kind of wooding,

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and you're just kind of awesome.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Very good.

38
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Yeah.

39
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've done, I've done, I mean,

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I've done, I've been made to the impressors

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
of my fellow Avengers.

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I think everyone does an impression

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
of Christopher Walken,

44
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
because he's such an easy kind of...

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You know, I feel like what this show needs is more cowbell.

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It depends on what you like me to say.

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Basically, there's no punctuation

48
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
in the coming out of my mouth.

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I like that.

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I know whole pages of heat.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You surprised me.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So there's a scene in the middle of the film,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
which you'll be familiar with.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You were there.

55
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No.

56
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The one person you don't need to explain to him.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
So there's...

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He remembers.

59
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're very good in this film.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did you see him in the middle of the film,

61
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
which is...

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Because Al Pacino and Robert De Niro.

63
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Sorry about you.

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
They're separated, like, a great thriller.

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
They're separated from...

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
for the entire film, and they meet twice,

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
once at the end of once in the middle.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And it takes place at a restaurant, L.A.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's a great scene.

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's one of the great pieces of screen acting.

71
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You can hope to watch. There it is.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's a picture of it.

73
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's like a...

74
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a mutual recognition of each other.

75
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Anyway, so there's a bit where they...

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
They sit and have coffee and have tea

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
and talk about stuff.

78
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm going on, I apologize.

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anyway, so Al Pacino, at one point...

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Al Pacino says this.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
He goes...

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So...

83
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
We're sitting here...

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Like a couple of regular fellas.

85
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I mean...

86
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You do what you do.

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I do what I got to do...

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If I'm there...

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
And I got to put you away...

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I won't like it.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
But if it's between you...

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
and some poor bastard...

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
who's wife, you're going to turn into a widow...

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Brother...

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are going down.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And then...

97
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
And then...

98
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And then a cut...

99
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
And then Michael Man cuts back to the esteemed gentleman

100
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
at the end of the sofa.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
What if you do got me backst in?

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And I got to put you down.

103
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm moving face to face.

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yeah.

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
But I will not hesitate.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Now for a second.

107
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
And that's my...

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is so...

109
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
This is so meta.

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I feel like I've gone into a parallel universe where...

111
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I...

112
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You were playing Gullisport.

113
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, I played Gullisport.

114
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, that's great.

115
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I do not get a press of Ken Brown.

116
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's my favorite scene.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Was he your favorite scene?

118
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yeah.

119
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Still.

120
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, no, no.

121
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
No, no, but my favorite scene that was written before...

122
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Not because of...

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm doing it, but I just...

124
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My favorite scene written in the film.

125
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

126
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You know, that's a great, great scene.

127
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yeah, it feels like it plays into singles in a way.

128
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah.

129
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
And it's like the most beautiful game of tennis.

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Did you do lots of takes?

131
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Did you do lots of takes?

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't think we did more than...

133
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Five to eight or nine.

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe a maybe less.

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And you talk about dreams and you talk about your life.

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No, no, no.

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's so great.

138
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so great.

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There's that bit in another bit where you go.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No, no, no.

141
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You say...

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You say, sir, he says...

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Patino says...

144
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
So you never wanted a regular type of life.

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And...

146
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Bob, may I call you Bob?

147
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yeah.

148
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Bob says...

149
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What's that?

150
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Bob accused of ball games?

151
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah.

152
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah.

153
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
If you have any ideas, I just...

154
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We could be related.

155
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because...

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Apparently...

157
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Apparently, there's some Irish stock in your past.

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No.

159
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I really could be.

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You never know.

161
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No.

162
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But you have an Irish name.

163
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do I?

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a new shape.

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
A new shape.

166
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
A new shape.

167
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It couldn't be more Irish.

168
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There's no one told you that till now.

169
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I've been told.

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But, you know, I think my mother just liked the name.

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Okay.

172
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Is it your...

173
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Christian?

174
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's my...

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think.

176
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let me educate you something.

177
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Black people...

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Black people are notorious for picking things that they saw one day and say that's my baby name.

179
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
That's how that was.

180
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
That's how it was.

181
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
There's no amazing story behind it.

182
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You love the tattoo.

183
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You have to actually came from Irish for a father that's not the case.

184
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Mother was reading the paper and she was eating some cereal.

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's not even backstay.

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, shame!

187
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
She said that'd be a good name for the baby.

188
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That's it.

189
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
That's how it happened.

190
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's it.

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on.

192
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But not nearly.

193
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are here promoting your movie, but Kevin, you're working at the same time.

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You're doing stand-up gigs.

195
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Double dipping.

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Yes.

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Doing a ton of stand-up shows, my What Now tours here as well.

198
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Major thank you to the UK fans.

199
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The tour sold out in literally two days.

200
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
So you guys are amazing.

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Baby Backwind.

202
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Yes.

203
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We do that.

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And then after that, we came over here for promo.

205
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What Cuba myself loved doing is really getting involved with the fans.

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You know, we love putting our feet in the street and really being active and interacting.

207
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So we've been doing a ton of pop-ups, just delivering the movie.

208
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The best of our ability was just laughing in person.

209
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
And we split in all the tour minds.

210
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That is not true.

211
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You got to hear.

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You got to hear.

213
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And then I'm here.

214
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes, not true.

215
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You know, you don't have a bunch of my stage dears.

216
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh, did he?

217
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
He tackled me from the back.

218
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Scared to live in mess out.

219
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It was one of the most frightening moments of my life.

220
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think we might have another frightening moment for you.

221
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This is you in Manchester.

222
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now, do you even know the name of that show?

223
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, no.

224
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What do you want to do?

225
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What's the only black guy today?

226
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Forever.

227
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
That's Coronation Street.

228
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Well done.

229
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
That's you in Beverly, kind of, with this picture.

230
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
This looks like you've been photoshopped in.

231
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yeah.

232
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you really there?

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No.

234
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Roy's Rolls can't be that big.

235
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
First of all, it looks like I grew up there.

236
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Obviously, your mother loves you because you heard daughter.

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yeah.

238
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But she is actually a fan as well.

239
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You know, we don't quite that.

240
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's, I know, she is, oh goodness, right.

241
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So, one day my mum came to set on the Star Wars set.

242
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And I was getting this thing called Cyber Scand,

243
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
which is where you stand in this kind of loads of cameras

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
and they kind of take your form and put you into a computer

245
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and make a toy or a...

246
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,000
some sort of merchandise or your face on a cushion.

247
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
And so, I go off and do this and I come back and mum's

248
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
like, I've made a great friend.

249
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm like, really? It's lovely. Excellent.

250
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And she likes the merchandise, you know, director of all of Star Wars

251
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
or something.

252
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
And I'm like, well, I'll say, you're very impressive.

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
And then before I know it, what comes in the post

254
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
is loads of cushions.

255
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
My face on it.

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So, my own mum, I guess, she gets to see it a fair amount, you know.

257
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But it's not enough.

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
So, I was kind of blown away how much merchandise there is.

259
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, it's all...

260
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
And it's just the beginning. It was like the pre-murchin does.

261
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Not even the real stuff is out yet and my mum has all of it.

262
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And it doesn't have that the doll yet.

263
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So, this is so...

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Is this in your flat or her house?

265
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Oh, God, yes.

266
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Okay, so basically, she thought it'd be really funny if I came home

267
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and it was everywhere in my...

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Okay, so this is...

269
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Is this her meleeous actual bedroom?

270
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Well, the...

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
LAUGHTER

272
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm not even going away.

273
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not even going to play the joke.

274
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
And then...

275
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh, and then...

276
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, my goodness.

277
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
And we found the photo, but it's not like that now.

278
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
That's my dream.

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There was another reason why I'm single.

280
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You took a first date back to that.

281
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Yeah.

282
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on in.

283
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
LAUGHTER

284
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I just think this little thing won't...

285
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't have a CV, I just have a bedroom.

286
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But this is cool, though.

287
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, your mother, a big fan, but...

288
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Brad Pitt, also a big fan.

289
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
That was the best night of my life.

290
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

291
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm just...

292
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Tell the story, big fan.

293
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh!

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm the story, big fan.

295
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There are two billion people.

296
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Yeah, there's a duvet.

297
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
We're only years.

298
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Sippers.

299
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
No, yeah, there was this auction thing that happened,

300
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
and I...

301
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
They called me and said, do you want to...

302
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you want to auction something off,

303
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
like maybe sort of an experience

304
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
watching the show with you or something?

305
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
And I was like, okay, it's lovely.

306
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's great for charity.

307
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yeah.

308
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It'll be for some...

309
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You know, something.

310
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
And it'll be fine.

311
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Anyway, so I get there.

312
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's basic.

313
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It'll be a good thing.

314
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I get there, and it's basically like this...

315
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's basic...

316
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's the Oscars.

317
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
There's so many celebrities in this room,

318
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
and I suddenly remember that I said

319
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
that I would auction something off,

320
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and so the fear grows.

321
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
So I was petrified, absolute petrified,

322
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
and then the person who's table I was on is a friend,

323
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
and he was being very kind and kind of put the paddle up,

324
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and I was like, thanks very much.

325
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's very sweet.

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
That'll be that.

327
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
And then someone else's paddle up,

328
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
went up across the other side of the room,

329
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
and I didn't really know, and then suddenly it was sort of

330
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
becoming a bit of money, and I was kind of thinking,

331
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
oh, this is absolutely mental,

332
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and someone went, it's Brad Pitt, and I was like, oh...

333
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Oh, my God.

334
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I like it, really.

335
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Yeah, exactly.

336
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And I look over to the room, and he's...

337
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Goes pedal up.

338
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Brad's paddle.

339
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Brad's paddle.

340
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
LAUGHTER

341
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Oh, it needs him.

342
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, not quite.

343
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Well, it didn't work out, because the person who's friend

344
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
who's my friend, I think it was probably all set up.

345
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Person who's...

346
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Who was my friend, ended up doing the highest bid.

347
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Boom!

348
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
LAUGHTER

349
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Friends.

350
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
LAUGHTER

351
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But, yeah, I just kind of looked over with just the most insane,

352
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
emoji heart eyes being like this is just the greatest moment of my life.

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now, Olimore, you are going to be singing for us.

354
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I am.

355
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, oh, oh!

356
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Kiss Cam!

357
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Oh, kiss cam!

358
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
LAUGHTER

359
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

360
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

361
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,840
Ohhh!

362
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Ohh!

363
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,720
We got this for you!

364
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,559
Aww!

365
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,320
Thank you very much!

366
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,799
It's like a pulse relationship. It's like a douche break down.

367
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,320
You have a mind...

368
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,840
You have a Cole. Dry things.

369
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,399
You have a Cole! Back off lady.

370
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh yeah, so we had to do the scene where she kisses,

371
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,639
Daisy kisses him and you know, you don't just kiss me

372
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,639
and I'll do the capriote.

373
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,279
We were sort of halfway through the scene

374
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,600
and I was sort of like here.

375
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Yeah?

376
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
Oh, sorry.

377
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Keep going, keep going.

378
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,960
I'll stay in the moment.

379
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
LAUGHTER

380
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
LAUGHTER

381
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,519
I was in a scene where I was in bed listening to the radio

382
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:57,160
because the voice of the man reading the shipping forecast

383
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:59,159
really turned me on.

384
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:01,159
LAUGHTER

385
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,159
This is the work I do.

386
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,159
LAUGHTER

387
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,159
So I was in bed and I had to be being turned on.

388
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,159
And I was getting slightly embarrassed and shy.

389
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,159
I was pregnant.

390
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:14,159
I was feeling mad as you are.

391
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,159
And Graham came over to me and he said,

392
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,159
OK, the noises that you're making,

393
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,159
could you make the noises that you might make getting

394
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,159
into a hot bath?

395
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,159
And that was it.

396
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:25,159
I was like,

397
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:31,159
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

398
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,159
LAUGHTER

399
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:33,159
Very good.

400
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:35,159
APPLAUSE

401
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,159
So we're going to be so many suspicious husbands tonight.

402
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:43,159
Yeah.

403
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,159
I was just thinking.

404
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,159
Yeah, exactly.

405
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,159
That can I just say?

406
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,159
Sound familiar, guys.

407
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:53,159
You're getting into a hot bath, aren't you?

408
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:55,159
LAUGHTER

409
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,159
That was very lazy.

410
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:59,159
You're getting into a hot bath.

411
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,159
I've been married a long time, aren't I?

412
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,159
I prefer when they act like they're getting into a cold bath with me.

413
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:07,159
LAUGHTER

414
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,159
It's because you get life.

415
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,159
I did want to be as well as you all.

416
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:15,159
That was what I thought I was going to be my entire life.

417
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:17,159
I wanted to study the...

418
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,159
LAUGHTER

419
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,159
Like a teacher, so...

420
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,159
I've learned a lot from you already.

421
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,159
LAUGHTER

422
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,159
You never met?

423
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,159
No, did we on the film?

424
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,159
No, but I was honored to know

425
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:31,159
and I was working on the same project.

426
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,159
Thank you.

427
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:33,159
Thank you.

428
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,159
Oh, what's going on?

429
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,159
Hey, man, so she's kind of taken.

430
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,159
LAUGHTER

431
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,159
Well, are you...

432
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,159
Why do you have...

433
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,159
LAUGHTER

434
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:48,159
LAUGHTER

435
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,159
LAUGHTER

436
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:52,159
LAUGHTER

437
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,159
LAUGHTER

438
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:56,159
You've made the sex and arguments in the past with your wife.

439
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,159
I have, yes. The biggest one I've found is that...

440
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,159
If you have an argument about an issue, stick to the issue.

441
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:04,159
Don't start getting personal.

442
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,159
LAUGHTER

443
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,159
And I was spiteful, that's the one in it.

444
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,159
Yeah.

445
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,159
So we were arguing and I just sort of lost it.

446
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,159
And I said, oh, shut up, monkey feet.

447
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,159
Oh, no.

448
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,159
I didn't pick this out of the air.

449
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,159
My wife has got massive toes.

450
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,159
You think you can impress yourself as well, Brad, did it?

451
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:25,159
I don't know.

452
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,159
I'm not going to be a big fan of you.

453
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:29,159
I'm not going to be a big fan of you.

454
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,159
I'm not going to be a big fan of you.

455
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:33,159
I'm not going to be a big fan of you.

456
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,159
LAUGHTER

457
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:37,159
You can impress yourself as well, Brad, did it?

458
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,159
Sometimes, if you want me to talk, I just...

459
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:42,159
Whenever comes into my head, I'll say,

460
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:44,159
I'm no no...

461
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:46,159
...when, or what it's going to be.

462
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,159
Is that your mum?

463
00:16:47,159 --> 00:16:49,159
LAUGHTER

464
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,159
This is a walking battle.

465
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:53,159
No, we're not.

466
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:55,159
So it's a family guy.

467
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,159
It's a family guy.

468
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,159
The characters you do, you do...

469
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:02,159
Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmire and then a...

470
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,159
...smattering of others.

471
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,159
OK.

472
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,159
And are they all based on people?

473
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,159
Are you just...

474
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,159
They come from various places.

475
00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,159
Peter, I knew a thousand Peter Griffins growing up

476
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:15,159
in New England, guys who would not think before they spoke.

477
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,159
Like...

478
00:17:16,159 --> 00:17:18,159
No, no, self-mediting mechanism.

479
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:21,159
It's coming out here with no gateway.

480
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,159
LAUGHTER

481
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,159
And when you're doing...

482
00:17:24,159 --> 00:17:26,159
...because, you know, those characters are in scenes together.

483
00:17:26,159 --> 00:17:27,159
Yeah.

484
00:17:27,159 --> 00:17:28,159
Do you do one line after the other?

485
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:30,159
Or do you all do one and then go back to the other one?

486
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,160
When I do a table read, yeah, I have to jump back and forth.

487
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
Hey, how what's going on?

488
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,160
Hello, Fat Man.

489
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Oh, Stewie, how are you?

490
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Back and forth.

491
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,160
It's good, right? That is good.

492
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
APPLAUSE

493
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,160
I was just telling a story about Midnight in Paris,

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,160
the Woody Allen film I was in.

495
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,160
And how I never had the whole script,

496
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,160
and I thought it was set in the 20s.

497
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,160
And I turned up and I bumped into Owen Wilson,

498
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
who didn't look like he was in the 20s at all.

499
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
And I said to him, I said,

500
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
so, wait, how on, who are you playing?

501
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
Because I'm playing F-Scope this Gerald,

502
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
and I know Corey Stolves playing on his hamming way,

503
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
and we're all playing figures of history,

504
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
and he went, oh, no, no, no, no, no.

505
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,160
I'm from now. I go back and play.

506
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,160
LAUGHTER

507
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
There's a time machine, you know?

508
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,160
It's kind of cool, and it's kind of wooding,

509
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,160
and you're just kind of awesome.

510
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
APPLAUSE

511
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,160
There was a director at Joe Schumacher,

512
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
who's a very funny man, very tall,

513
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
very sort of eccentric,

514
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,160
and he would direct with a speaker,

515
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
with a microphone and a speaker.

516
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,160
Usually directors will come up and say,

517
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
hey, I don't know, Johnny.

518
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
He'll be like, oh, car, and you'd hear this, you know,

519
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,160
trying to fool me in voice.

520
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,160
And I bolted into this suit.

521
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
I can't move.

522
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
And he would literally go,

523
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
and he would direct you, like,

524
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,160
as if you would have some emotional scene.

525
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,160
And he would go, okay, people, all right?

526
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:52,160
George, your parents are dead.

527
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
You haven't.

528
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Nothing to live for.

529
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
LAUGHTER

530
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Oh, my God.

531
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
LAUGHTER

532
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,160
You're not doing well.

533
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,160
And that man.

534
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
And time.

535
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
LAUGHTER

536
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,160
That happened a dream, Jimmy.

537
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,160
That's true.

538
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,160
You really were a blue coat, weren't you?

539
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,160
I wasn't blue coat. Yeah, at the place you showed.

540
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:18,160
Which was next door to He Shum Nuclear Power Station.

541
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,160
I think it is. I got a settler,

542
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,160
and I was, I worked a really good one in Yarmouth,

543
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,160
great Yarmouth, got sacked, which is another story.

544
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,160
And then sacked, and then, and was sent to,

545
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
we'll move on to that in a minute.

546
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
But, you sent to this,

547
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,160
sent to that one as a sort of punishment.

548
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,160
It was like, you're going to Morkham to do six months.

549
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Because you have just...

550
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,160
You've just done something which...

551
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
What had you done?

552
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
Well, something that was considered cheeky in the 70s,

553
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,160
but now is illegal.

554
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
LAUGHTER

555
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Oh, whoa.

556
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
No, that's actually...

557
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,160
It was actually an incident where it was my first attempt at stand-up comedy.

558
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,160
And what happened was, I...

559
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
I'd always wanted to do stand-up comedy.

560
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,160
I didn't have the guts to do it.

561
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
I got very drunk.

562
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,160
I had to go at doing it as a blue coat.

563
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
My mate said to me,

564
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,160
just copy all the other comedians at Pontons and steal the jokes,

565
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,160
and basically, talk to the front row.

566
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
So you're supposed to say, were you from?

567
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
They say Scotland, you say, who paid for your holiday?

568
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Were you from Wales?

569
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,160
You make an oys like a sheep? Rubbish jokes, all right?

570
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,160
But I said, that's terrible.

571
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
He said, don't worry, you're just padding.

572
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
What you're doing is you're looking for comedy gold,

573
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,160
which is, were you from?

574
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,160
They say Kent, and you say, what did you call me?

575
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,160
Now at Pontons, this used to take the roof off, right?

576
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,160
LAUGHTER

577
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,160
So I tried it, but I was very drunk.

578
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,160
LAUGHTER

579
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
So I go on stage,

580
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,160
and I say, were you from...

581
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,160
I said, I said, Scotland,

582
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I can't remember the joke.

583
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,160
LAUGHTER

584
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,160
I say, hello.

585
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,160
LAUGHTER

586
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
Then I said to, were you from?

587
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,160
The guy says, Wales, I'd black out, and I go, hi.

588
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,160
Hi, panic.

589
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,160
And then I say, anyone in from Kent?

590
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
LAUGHTER

591
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,160
And this bloke shouts out me.

592
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,160
LAUGHTER

593
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,160
And I said, well, you're a f***er.

594
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,160
LAUGHTER

595
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,160
LAUGHTER

596
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,160
LAUGHTER

597
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,160
LAUGHTER

598
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
So...

599
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,160
LAUGHTER

600
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,160
So I missed it.

601
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,160
LAUGHTER

602
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,160
So I said to walk him.

603
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,160
LAUGHTER

604
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,160
It's so unusual to have two such young Oscar winners.

605
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
This is normally something you have to do.

606
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,160
That's why we're friends.

607
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,160
Yeah.

608
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,160
You've got them in the neat club.

609
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,160
The other thing you share is quite short-lived careers in modeling.

610
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Oh, I thought you just said short-lived careers.

611
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
Wow.

612
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,160
I was like, oh.

613
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,160
Happy New Year.

614
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
So...

615
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
So because you...

616
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Now, what was your big break?

617
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,160
Was it Vogue a Squire?

618
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Or all of the above?

619
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Talk about modeling.

620
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,160
Talk about it.

621
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Or was it, in fact, an actual...

622
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
I don't know.

623
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,160
I think it's about to talk about modeling.

624
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,160
Oh, my God.

625
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,160
It's a car.

626
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
No, yes, because he did...

627
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Look at these.

628
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Like, it's hard to make a jumper sexy.

629
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
True that.

630
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,160
But I think he's happy to see...

631
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,160
LAUGHTER

632
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,160
LAUGHTER

633
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,160
That's more...

634
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,160
That's more...

635
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,160
That's more like Potter.

636
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,160
I mean, Cersei.

637
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Your sweater has eyeballs.

638
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
LAUGHTER

639
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,160
That was a high point.

640
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh, my God.

641
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
I think you can actually still buy that.

642
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,160
And the point of that is you can learn to knit it yourself.

643
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,160
So you...

644
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh.

645
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,160
You guys can take one of those home and knit it yourself.

646
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,160
I can buy the sweater and then I have to do it myself.

647
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,160
Yeah.

648
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
Actually, there's a classic thing in here.

649
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
So, you know, when you want something of Christmas

650
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
and you say to your mommy, your granny,

651
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I'd really like a really trendy sweat top.

652
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
I'd like a really nice trendy zippy-up set top.

653
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,160
And then they knit it for you.

654
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
LAUGHTER

655
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,160
Oh, no!

656
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,160
That's the Christmas nightmare.

657
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,160
Isn't it?

658
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,160
But you still do some modeling, don't you?

659
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,160
A sporadically and very unsuccessfully.

660
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,160
Oh, stop it. You do.

661
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:20,160
No, I'm not.

662
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,160
You do.

663
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
What I did do...

664
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,160
I did some...

665
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,160
I did a campaign for Burberry, which was very amazing.

666
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
And I did it a few years ago.

667
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,160
And Marieta Stino shot it.

668
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Cool.

669
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,160
And I remember doing it.

670
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,160
It was when I was just starting out.

671
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,160
In this photograph, there was a sort of...

672
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,160
There was a model and me and actor, one-of-be-actor,

673
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,160
and a musician.

674
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
And Marieta Stino, who I'd never worked with,

675
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,160
who is one of the most extraordinary brilliant people,

676
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,160
but he's just almost in that moment.

677
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,160
He was almost like a sort of parody of himself.

678
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,160
So, we had to run and jump for the photograph.

679
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,160
And he goes...

680
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,160
He's literally got the camera there and he goes,

681
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,160
OK, so battling.

682
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
You're supermodel.

683
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,160
You rock star.

684
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
You're movie star.

685
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
I'm Marieta Stino.

686
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
I want to see golf!

687
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I'm dancing to the air.

688
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
I'm dancing to the air.

689
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
These two sort of pros.

690
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
I'm leaving with this shot.

691
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,160
He gets the photos because they're so natural,

692
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
ones of shock and minor despair.

693
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,160
And wonder, I think it was the same time.

694
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
Because you don't have my pictures.

695
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
No, I don't.

696
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Because I'll tell you why.

697
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Yes, tell us why.

698
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Because it's really amazing, jump together.

699
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
I was an Abercrombie model.

700
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
Get in.

701
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Abercrombie, a bitch like this, gentlemen.

702
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160
Don't make your hoots.

703
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,160
They're doing it to the story.

704
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,160
We have to pitch.

705
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
So, my pictures never came out.

706
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,160
I did the whole campaign and the pictures never came out.

707
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
And I didn't know why.

708
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,160
And my agent wrote and asked why.

709
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,160
And they literally only responded with the photos.

710
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Because they...

711
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Their whole idea was like, we want real people.

712
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,160
So, they...

713
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
I don't know.

714
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
We were on a beach and then they threw us a football.

715
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
And they're like, play football.

716
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,160
And all the other models were playing football

717
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
in a pretty way.

718
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
And I'm like, and that me.

719
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
I was all of the photos.

720
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I've got a red face covered in sweat.

721
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,160
My nostrils are flared.

722
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,160
I'm like, no!

723
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
I'm going to give a picture.

724
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,160
And like a one-pointed girl yelled,

725
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
just get her away from me.

726
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,160
That's all.

727
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,160
That's all.

728
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
That's all.

729
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
Yeah.

730
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
Well, you know, she's in the story.

731
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,160
When you...

732
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Was you in college?

733
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,160
Yeah.

734
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
You did something quite extreme to meet ladies.

735
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,160
I wasn't...

736
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,160
I became a cheerleader.

737
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
Now, see, that's...

738
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,160
What?

739
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,160
Yeah.

740
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,160
Now, see, that seems quite an out there thing to do.

741
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,160
Well, it wasn't necessarily just to meet a woman.

742
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,160
It was so I could travel to all the places that the team went to meet women.

743
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,160
Oh, my God.

744
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Yes, Mark.

745
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,160
I was going to all these other schools and...

746
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,160
But did you have pom-poms and stuff?

747
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,160
I had a megaphone.

748
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,160
You're a big dude.

749
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,160
Yeah, the girls had pom-poms, but...

750
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
I went to an all-male school across the street,

751
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,160
was an all-woman school spellman.

752
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,160
So we got our cheerleader, our female cheerleader, just from there.

753
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,160
So I was the only one who volunteered to be a cheerleader that year.

754
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
So I talked my roommate into doing it,

755
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
and he was like,

756
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
this is awesome.

757
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
We get to pick all the girls, so we pick them.

758
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,160
And we got to travel all these other schools to meet women.

759
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
What was totally dope?

760
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
Oh, my God.

761
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,160
Great plan.

762
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I'm such a fan.

763
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,160
I'm like, this is huge.

764
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
But did you have to do cheerleading?

765
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Did you have to do the chants?

766
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
We had some cheerers, but basically, we would go...

767
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
I mean, my roommate now would go,

768
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,160
hey gang!

769
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,160
Hey gang!

770
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
And then the girls would do the cheer.

771
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,160
They'd do some clips and we'd like...

772
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,160
We weren't picking them up.

773
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
We were picking them up, holding them up, or anything.

774
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
That's it.

775
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,160
You're just like a big gang.

776
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Yeah, no, basically it.

777
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
You know?

778
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,160
And every now and then we do some cheerers

779
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,160
like, you know, Edward, Edward, he's our man.

780
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
If he can't do it, fuck it.

781
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,160
When you're single at the moment,

782
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,160
I am.

783
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
And Kylie, you're single at the moment.

784
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Now, meeting people and dating is hard enough.

785
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
But Kamen DeHaz and Kylie...

786
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,160
I'm single.

787
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Well, hello.

788
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:12,160
I wasn't sure.

789
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,160
I was going to include you, and it wasn't sure.

790
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,160
Well, lucky for you, Russell.

791
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,160
And you're married.

792
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,160
Lights out like a power router.

793
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
Oh!

794
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,160
Oh!

795
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:33,160
I can feel the mist every time we kiss.

796
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,160
Just didn't know it down for like this.

797
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:41,160
There's a flash for the warning.

798
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,160
Will it wear your ring in the morning?

799
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,160
There'll be bottles in the bag.

800
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
You're amazing.

801
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Right answer.

802
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
So are you.

803
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,160
Do you have a yoga move you could bust out for a quick take?

804
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,160
I have a few, yeah.

805
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
What's the most impressive thing you can do with that?

806
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
Well, I am one, but I might want someone to spot me.

807
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Yes, I'll do...

808
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
I'm...

809
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
I mean, if we're with anyone, it's eye meat.

810
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,160
It's a good one for sure.

811
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Really?

812
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Oh, my God, you're so good.

813
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,160
Okay, wait.

814
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,160
Stand here.

815
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,160
I'm sure.

816
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,160
Just put your arm kind of like that.

817
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Put my arm kind of like that.

818
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
Okay, wait.

819
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
And we're like, this is pretty exciting.

820
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,160
Yes, I love this.

821
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,160
I'm going to yoga both of you.

822
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,160
This is great.

823
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,160
It's herty baby.

824
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,160
I'm going to keep my legs up.

825
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,160
And then just, I'm going to hit your arm for once.

826
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,160
Do I need to catch you or don't need to just...

827
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,160
Just drop me from going over that way and then I can balance.

828
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,160
Okay, oh, this is fantastic.

829
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,160
This is fantastic.

830
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,160
Oh my God.

831
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,160
Wow.

832
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
Oh, wow.

833
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,160
Wow.

834
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,160
Wow.

835
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Very nice.

836
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Wow.

837
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Thank you.

838
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Do you believe me?

839
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
I'm so proud of you.

840
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
You do a Liam.

841
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Oh.

842
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
I bet you do when he's not here.

843
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
Damn, I should have asked you before he showed up.

844
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:59,160
I'm doing him paisley.

845
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,160
Why are us at night?

846
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:07,160
You're doing cool and with, thank you.

847
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
What?

848
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,160
The cool one.

849
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
No.

850
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,160
I feel like, like, danceman.

851
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,160
I feel like I'm just going to make sick of barfings.

852
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
Do it.

853
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
You're making sick of that.

854
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,160
Fucking seal, aren't I?

855
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Graham Dorphson.

856
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
You know, you're an Irishman.

857
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,160
You think these people accept you as one of their own, but they do.

858
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
They do accept you as whole.

859
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,160
Yes, Brian, we like some cool whip.

860
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,160
But why are you saying it like that?

861
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:34,160
Why do I have to say I'm saying cool whip?

862
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,160
You're saying cool whip.

863
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,160
Yes, I'm saying cool whip.

864
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,160
You're putting a lot of emphasis on the age.

865
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Cool whip.

866
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,160
I'm saying cool whip.

867
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,160
It's so cool.

868
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,160
Cool.

869
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm a man.

870
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm a secretive level superman.

871
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,160
Okay, let's start.

872
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,160
Let's start.

873
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,160
Let's start.

874
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Come on, do one line at a time.

875
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
What line shall I do?

876
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
I don't know.

877
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
I don't know.

878
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
I feel the need.

879
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,160
The need for speed.

880
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
You're good at it.

881
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,160
Do me.

882
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,160
No, no.

883
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I'm not.

884
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
I'm not.

885
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,160
I'm not.

886
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm not.

887
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
I'm not.

888
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,160
I'm not.

889
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,160
I'm not.

890
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm not.

891
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I'm not.

892
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,160
I'm not.

893
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,160
I'm not.

894
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I'm not.

895
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
I'm not.

896
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,160
I'm not.

897
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Who you at?

898
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Who you at.

899
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
Who you at?

900
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
Who you at?

901
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Who you at?

902
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
Who you at?

903
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,160
Who you at?

904
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,160
Who you at?

905
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Who you at?

906
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
They do to...

907
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Who, who?

908
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Who?

909
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,160
Who?

910
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,160
Who you at?

911
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,160
Who you at?

912
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:30,160
I knew you used to be able to do Sean Connery.

913
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
Oh, yeah you could.

914
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,600
In fact, sometimes I would call up my agent and say,

915
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,160
Hello, I know it's a Sean Connery.

916
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,160
To, uh, Edelamator please.

917
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
And I immediately got through.

918
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,600
LAUGHTER

919
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,360
How about it, Ken, Mr. Leab?

920
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,800
LAUGHTER

921
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
LAUGHTER

922
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,960
That's a double deck.

923
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,519
You do, Donald Duck?

924
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,000
Yeah. Do you? Do it.

925
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,519
OK, now it's your turn.

926
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,040
LAUGHTER

927
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,240
Err...

928
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
Err...

929
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Err...

930
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,440
LAUGHTER

931
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
APPLAUSE

932
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,880
A small dragon is back?

933
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,160
He is, yeah.

934
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,600
A crystal of finished business.

935
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,599
And I read that that as a voice, that there isn't...

936
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:16,000
I mean, obviously it's put through treatments and things,

937
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,159
but actually, it sounds very like what you did.

938
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:21,679
Oh, God. Do you always do that as well?

939
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:22,959
If you can.

940
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:24,559
Err...

941
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,759
So...

942
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:26,759
...around...

943
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,439
Oh, my God.

944
00:31:28,439 --> 00:31:29,439
LAUGHTER

945
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:32,959
Is your heart beating faster?

946
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:34,480
LAUGHTER

947
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,079
Still not enough.

948
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,279
Oh, God.

949
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,039
Wow.

950
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:41,839
That's on the wrong side, so I'm not.

951
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,839
Yeah.

952
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:44,839
Yeah.

953
00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:46,839
That's Clint Eastwood described as,

954
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:49,119
you hit a few marks, you say a few lines.

955
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,639
What's the problem?

956
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:51,519
LAUGHTER

957
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,879
Very good.

958
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:54,879
I don't know what this means, either.

959
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:56,879
I can't remember.

960
00:31:56,879 --> 00:31:59,720
So, when you're in a Clint Eastwood movie,

961
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,720
you don't even know the camera's rolling,

962
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,519
and you just hear over your shoulder.

963
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
All right, go ahead.

964
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,519
LAUGHTER

965
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:10,519
LAUGHTER

966
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,519
So, you're doing something.

967
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,519
LAUGHTER

968
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,519
And...

969
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,519
You know...

970
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,519
You do it sometimes, you're doing some pretty hot stuff,

971
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,519
and you just keep doing it until you hear him say,

972
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,519
that's enough of that.

973
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,519
LAUGHTER

974
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,119
And then you move on, and you're on to the next set of,

975
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,519
it's intimidating as hell.

976
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
Please record your personal drink.

977
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
To end recording, key zero.

978
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,519
So, you press zero.

979
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,519
Don't record it.

980
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,519
Read that, then you press zero again.

981
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:41,519
Show me where zero is.

982
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,519
Zero is that one.

983
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:44,519
There's also your paper.

984
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:45,519
Endre...

985
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,519
I start?

986
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,519
Yeah.

987
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,519
I don't know who you are.

988
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,519
I don't have any money.

989
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,519
LAUGHTER

990
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:56,519
LAUGHTER

991
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,519
Oh my god, look at that!

992
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
It's so good.

993
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:04,519
But when I do have...

994
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,519
LAUGHTER

995
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,519
...our very specific set of skills.

996
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,519
LAUGHTER

997
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,519
Fills that make me a nightmare.

998
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,519
LAUGHTER

999
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:14,519
For somebody like you?

1000
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:17,519
I don't know if my daughter will go now.

1001
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,519
I will find you.

1002
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,519
And I will kill you.

1003
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,519
You said you were here with Harrison Ford before.

1004
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,519
You did an incredible Chubaka,

1005
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:29,519
but I'm told you also do a jaw jaw binks.

1006
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,519
LAUGHTER

1007
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,519
Oh, no, that's a big sumo.

1008
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,519
LAUGHTER

1009
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,519
This hand is your hand.

1010
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,519
This hand is my hand.

1011
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,519
No, wait, that's your hand.

1012
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,519
Oh, no, that's my hand.

1013
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,519
LAUGHTER

1014
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,519
Oh, you explain this tweet that was sent to the show.

1015
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,519
I hope you're not unhappy with yourselves.

1016
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,519
But you're looking forward to this.

1017
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:53,519
This is Thomas.

1018
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,519
So, which of you knows Thomas?

1019
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,519
You.

1020
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,519
So, what's your name?

1021
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,519
I'm Jessica.

1022
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,519
Jessica.

1023
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,519
And why is Thomas upset with us?

1024
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,519
Thomas is upset because I've postponed a date for the second time,

1025
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,519
so I could come and be here and meet him.

1026
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:13,519
I'm getting a slime for everything.

1027
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,519
Is he your boyfriend?

1028
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,519
No, no.

1029
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,519
We have not been on a date yet.

1030
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,519
So, you put him off for the first time?

1031
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:23,519
No, no.

1032
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,519
Why did you put him off for the first time?

1033
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:27,519
My sister, and this time Kylie.

1034
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,519
OK, you know that will not bat into you.

1035
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:33,519
Are you into him?

1036
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,519
You don't know?

1037
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:37,519
Well, really.

1038
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,519
Really not bat into him.

1039
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,519
She's four months twice.

1040
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,519
Can I suggest you take him out tomorrow night when this is on?

1041
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:47,519
LAUGHTER

1042
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,519
Let's...

1043
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,519
Let's make this means visit to the Red Chair just before we go.

1044
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,519
Hello, who's there?

1045
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,519
Hello, sir.

1046
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,519
Hello, what's your name?

1047
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,519
Thomas.

1048
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:58,519
OK, and where are you from?

1049
00:34:58,519 --> 00:34:59,519
From Durham.

1050
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:00,519
Durham.

1051
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,519
All right, but you live here now?

1052
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:02,519
Yes.

1053
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,519
OK, very good.

1054
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,519
I'll be going with this story, Thomas.

1055
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,519
So, I asked a girl a couple of weeks ago, and she said yes,

1056
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,519
which was great because she's quite hot and, like,

1057
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,519
I really got a job going on.

1058
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:14,519
I've got you a couple of weeks and once.

1059
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:16,519
And I'm a rescheduled for tonight.

1060
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,519
And she's held it on me again,

1061
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,519
so she could come here and watch Kylie and Owen.

1062
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:24,519
So, I have no plans tonight.

1063
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:27,519
I thought I'd come down and see if she wanted to re-arrange for next week.

1064
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,519
Well, can I say, Thomas, you're very keen,

1065
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,519
because she has given you no indication that she is.

1066
00:35:38,519 --> 00:35:40,519
Oh, dear. Well, I guess you didn't look...

1067
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,519
The good thing is you didn't make other plans.

1068
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:43,519
That's good. Yeah.

1069
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:45,519
OK, so this is your decision now.

1070
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:46,519
This is you.

1071
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:49,519
This is you sending a message to him.

1072
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,519
So, Jessica, are we going to flip Thomas?

1073
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:54,519
Or are we going to let Thomas walk?

1074
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,519
This is... Oh, OK.

1075
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:00,519
Please get Kylie to... Kylie, please, will you...

1076
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:02,519
Leave her him off the red check.

1077
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:03,519
Oh, no!

1078
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,519
Oh, no!

1079
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,519
Oh, no!

1080
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:06,519
Oh, no!

1081
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:07,519
Oh, no!

1082
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:09,519
That's the worst ever!

1083
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:10,519
Oh, no!

1084
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:12,519
It's a same name. It's a same name.

1085
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:13,519
Oh!

1086
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,519
Oh!

1087
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,519
Oh, my God.

1088
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,519
I love it.

1089
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:20,519
I love it.

1090
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,519
I love it.

1091
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,519
Wow, literally dumped.

1092
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,519
I think everyone won't have the date when you got dumped.

1093
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes!

1094
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,519
Oh!

1095
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,519
He's going to be having nightmares.

1096
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,519
The rest of his life would go to him.

1097
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:33,519
Oh, he's really shocked.

1098
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,519
Can you believe it?

1099
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:35,519
Oh!

1100
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,519
Oh, Jessica, what are you thinking?

1101
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:39,519
That's a very loud voice.

1102
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:40,519
Bush.

1103
00:36:40,519 --> 00:36:44,519
And a very sexy bit of PR, of course, that the mighty Farell,

1104
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:45,519
he co-wrote...

1105
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,519
Do you write all of this on?

1106
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,519
I've reduced the whole album.

1107
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:49,519
I've reduced the whole album.

1108
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:50,519
Yes, sir.

1109
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,519
Wow.

1110
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:54,519
Now, is it true that Farell, he was the one encouraging you

1111
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:58,519
to be a bit more family-friendly, a bit more mainstream-wise?

1112
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:01,519
Yeah, yeah, he made me change certain words.

1113
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,519
I had a song called So Many Holes.

1114
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,519
He made it So Many Proves.

1115
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,519
Well, that certainly toned it down.

1116
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,519
On prose, just prostitutes.

1117
00:37:12,519 --> 00:37:13,519
No.

1118
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,519
They're professionals.

1119
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,519
Oh, I see.

1120
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,519
But silly me.

1121
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:22,519
The ladies in the video still look quite like hoes.

1122
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:24,519
They're professional.

1123
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:27,519
They're in a video.

1124
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,519
And then Farell, is it true that he...

1125
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,519
I mean, I'm sure you enjoyed working with you,

1126
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,519
but he did have some difficulties working with you as well.

1127
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,519
Yeah, and when we were working on a particular song called

1128
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,519
California Raw, Stevie Wonder,

1129
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,519
he came up to the studio, and Farell had called a second-hand

1130
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,519
contact from being in the studio with me,

1131
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,519
and he kind of froze.

1132
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,519
He didn't know how to produce it anymore.

1133
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,519
He was stuck.

1134
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,519
He was like...

1135
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,519
Might have to explain what the...

1136
00:37:58,519 --> 00:37:59,519
Yes.

1137
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,519
So Farell was in an environment created by Snoop.

1138
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:08,519
Farell was no longer the same Farell.

1139
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,519
It's not gonna stop.

1140
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,519
Yes.

1141
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:12,519
He was...

1142
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:14,519
He was now someone else.

1143
00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:15,519
He was not...

1144
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,519
He was not the greatest producer in the world.

1145
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,519
He was the greatest producer in the world.

1146
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:21,519
He's a guy in the room.

1147
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,519
Excellent.

1148
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
Excellent.

1149
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:24,519
He's going to the next...

1150
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:26,519
He's going to the next...

1151
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,519
Oh, chill.

1152
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,519
Oh, yeah.

1153
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,519
Oh, oh.

1154
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,519
Oh, my God.

1155
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,519
Oh, my God.

1156
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,519
Take that card, Elevine.

1157
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,519
Oh, my God.

1158
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,519
Oh, my God.

1159
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:38,519
Oh, my God.

1160
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,519
I'm actually talking about it.

1161
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,519
I'm actually talking about it.

1162
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:44,519
I'm actually talking about it.

1163
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:45,519
I'm sorry.

1164
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,519
I'm sorry.

1165
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,519
I'm sorry.

1166
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,519
I'm sorry.

1167
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,519
They're not competitive.

1168
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:51,519
They're not competitive.

1169
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,519
They're not competitive.

1170
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:55,519
You won't want to buy a thing about that one of yours.

1171
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:56,519
Could you pick a winner?

1172
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:57,519
The before winner?

1173
00:38:57,519 --> 00:39:01,519
I mean, I'm not saying anything but we are in a movie together.

1174
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:04,519
I'm not going to just go for no one else.

1175
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:05,519
She so wants to win.

1176
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:06,519
Yeah.

1177
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:07,519
Do you want to win?

1178
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,519
Okay, yeah.

1179
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:09,519
She's the best.

1180
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:10,519
Yeah.

1181
00:39:10,519 --> 00:39:12,519
This is a weird thing.

1182
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:17,679
Chris Pratt, this seems so unlikely that you have now learned how to do the voices from

1183
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,679
Towing.

1184
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:19,679
Yeah, sort of.

1185
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:20,679
Yeah.

1186
00:39:20,679 --> 00:39:27,519
Well, I mean, we love that garbage TV back in the States.

1187
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,519
My wife was crazy about it.

1188
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:34,519
And when I was here filming Guardians, we shot Guardians of the Galaxy here in London.

1189
00:39:34,519 --> 00:39:39,519
And my wife, Anna, came out to visit and she fell in love with the show Towing.

1190
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:40,519
The only way is Essex.

1191
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,519
It's this show that's like basically their Jersey shorts.

1192
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:45,519
The Jersey Shore from here.

1193
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:46,519
Right.

1194
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:54,519
It's like this town somewhere, Essex, I guess, and these folks are just like the worst.

1195
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,519
And it was like, I'm a parrot a little bit.

1196
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:03,199
And so when I hear it all the time, I just started picking it up and started like I could pick

1197
00:40:03,199 --> 00:40:05,199
up their accent and do their accent a little bit.

1198
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:06,199
These are them and I'm like, yeah, I'm okay.

1199
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:10,199
It's going to sound like this is a really embarrassing to do in front of a whole room full

1200
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,199
of brits here, but I'll try it anyways.

1201
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:19,199
So it's like, it's like, honestly, I like, I saw this guy.

1202
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:25,199
Yeah, it's like, I was like, I just, they did like Michael Cheat on me when he was in a

1203
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:26,199
beef heart.

1204
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,199
Because he's telling me, he's like, you know, I miss you or whatever.

1205
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,199
And I'm like, you miss me.

1206
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,199
I want my mother.

1207
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:37,199
I'm so proud of you.

1208
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:42,199
I think it was a, some tips, I would say.

1209
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,199
Some tips on boxing.

1210
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:49,199
We've got a very, very, very high tech piece of equipment over here.

1211
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:52,199
So if you'd like to come with me, it's over here.

1212
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,199
The eye, the eye.

1213
00:40:57,199 --> 00:40:59,199
We've been playing with this all afternoon.

1214
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,199
I lunged this thing.

1215
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:03,199
Okay, so I'm turning on.

1216
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,199
It's on.

1217
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,199
Now, ooh, okay, there we go.

1218
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:10,199
So I hit that.

1219
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:11,199
Yeah.

1220
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,199
Okay, so, ooh.

1221
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:15,199
It didn't talk.

1222
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,199
It didn't talk this afternoon.

1223
00:41:20,199 --> 00:41:21,199
What's happened to it?

1224
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:22,199
Shut up.

1225
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:26,199
Just hear it, just hear it.

1226
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:27,199
Just hear it.

1227
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:28,199
It's all about it.

1228
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,199
That was really good.

1229
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,199
Not only you serious.

1230
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:33,199
He's ready to go.

1231
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:36,199
Okay.

1232
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:39,199
Now, do you have any tips?

1233
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:40,199
Do you have any tips?

1234
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:42,199
Because you're in high heels.

1235
00:41:42,199 --> 00:41:43,199
Should I take them off?

1236
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:44,199
No, not you, I think.

1237
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,199
Okay.

1238
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,199
We're, we're taking this very seriously.

1239
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:50,199
He's talking to me.

1240
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,199
I mean, no run-ups.

1241
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,199
If you want to take them off, whatever you feel,

1242
00:41:57,199 --> 00:41:59,199
I would never be thinking about run-ups.

1243
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:02,199
So Rachel, go for it.

1244
00:42:02,199 --> 00:42:03,199
No, don't, don't take your shoes off.

1245
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,199
I'll just hit like a girl in these.

1246
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,199
Go on, Rachel.

1247
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,199
Yeah, so, so competitive.

1248
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:09,199
Wow.

1249
00:42:14,199 --> 00:42:15,199
She's down.

1250
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,199
She's down.

1251
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,199
She's, she's slim.

1252
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,199
She's slim.

1253
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:19,199
Okay.

1254
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,199
Okay.

1255
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:22,199
Okay.

1256
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:23,199
A flip.

1257
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:24,199
What do you want?

1258
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,199
You should do it.

1259
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,199
Do you want to go straight?

1260
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,199
Or do you want to go?

1261
00:42:28,199 --> 00:42:29,199
Oh, I don't mind.

1262
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,199
I just feel like I could hit.

1263
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,199
Oh, then you seem keen.

1264
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:32,199
Go on, man.

1265
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:33,199
Get any other advice?

1266
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:34,199
Are you left or right-handed?

1267
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,199
Right.

1268
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:36,199
Right.

1269
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,199
So you know, right, like back,

1270
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,199
so you really get the whole right grip.

1271
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:39,199
Right, like back.

1272
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:40,199
Okay.

1273
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,199
And the aim is just to hit it so it goes away.

1274
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:42,199
You go, you do that.

1275
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:44,199
You go boom, and it goes back up.

1276
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:45,199
Okay.

1277
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,199
You go, Graham.

1278
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,199
I, honestly, mine was so bad.

1279
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,199
So let's see what Rachel gets,

1280
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:52,199
and then I'm the side of what I'm going to do it.

1281
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,199
You got a score.

1282
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,199
Yeah, you got a score.

1283
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:56,199
You got a score.

1284
00:42:56,199 --> 00:42:57,199
So you're left leg forward.

1285
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,199
Yeah, yeah.

1286
00:42:58,199 --> 00:42:59,199
Are you in range, though?

1287
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,199
Are you in range?

1288
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,199
Oh, I don't know.

1289
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:02,199
Let's just let I find out.

1290
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:03,199
Is that...

1291
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:04,199
Come forward a bit, come forward a bit.

1292
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,199
Yeah.

1293
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:06,199
Because you want to remember your aim is to punch through the bag.

1294
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:08,199
Through, so I want to go like that.

1295
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:09,199
Yes, I like that.

1296
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:10,199
What's the score?

1297
00:43:10,199 --> 00:43:13,199
I'm just hitting the middle.

1298
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:14,199
Come on.

1299
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,199
Turn around.

1300
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:17,199
Oh!

1301
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:21,199
Let me go, let me go, let me go.

1302
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:23,199
One eighty-two.

1303
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,199
One eighty-two.

1304
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,199
Who's going to that?

1305
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,199
Who's going to that?

1306
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:29,199
Let me go next?

1307
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:30,199
Okay, here we go.

1308
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:31,199
Okay, what do I need to?

1309
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,199
One eighty-two to beat.

1310
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,199
One eighty-two.

1311
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:34,199
Okay.

1312
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:35,199
Here we go.

1313
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:36,199
Oh.

1314
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:37,199
That's a good one.

1315
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:38,199
That's a good one.

1316
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:39,199
That's a good one.

1317
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,199
That's a good one.

1318
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:41,199
It's a good one.

1319
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:43,199
Is it a table thing when you don't care, and then you do.

1320
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,199
Come and just have a stand down with you.

1321
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:49,199
And it's him last first, Lou.

1322
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,199
What?

1323
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:52,199
Okay.

1324
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,199
Oh!

1325
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,199
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

1326
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,199
Wow!

1327
00:43:57,199 --> 00:43:59,199
That's a good one.

1328
00:43:59,199 --> 00:44:01,199
That's a good one.

1329
00:44:01,199 --> 00:44:02,199
That's a good one.

1330
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:03,199
It's five nine four.

1331
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,199
Oh no.

1332
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:10,199
It's five nine four.

1333
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,199
Oh no.

1334
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:18,199
It's five nine four to beat.

1335
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:19,199
Five nine four to beat.

1336
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:21,199
Here we go, here we go.

1337
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,199
Oh!

1338
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:23,199
Oh!

1339
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,199
Oh!

1340
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,199
Wow!

1341
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,199
Okay.

1342
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,199
Anthony Joshua, I'll do it.

1343
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,199
How you doing?

1344
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:32,199
How you doing?

1345
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,199
How you doing?

1346
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,199
How you doing?

1347
00:44:34,199 --> 00:44:35,199
No, I'm so good.

1348
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,199
How you doing?

1349
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:37,199
How you doing?

1350
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:38,199
How you doing?

1351
00:44:38,199 --> 00:44:39,199
I'm just okay, okay.

1352
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:40,199
Okay.

1353
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:42,199
No, no, no, no.

1354
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:43,199
Oh no, I'm going to do this.

1355
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:44,199
I'm going to do this.

1356
00:44:44,199 --> 00:44:45,199
Here we go, here we go.

1357
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:46,199
Oh, look, I'm still going.

1358
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,199
Okay, there you go.

1359
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:48,199
Okay.

1360
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:49,199
What was yours?

1361
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:50,199
Eight.

1362
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:51,199
Eight.

1363
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:52,199
I think it was three thousand.

1364
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:55,199
No, it's six, seven two, was it?

1365
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:56,199
Six.

1366
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,199
What?

1367
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,199
Six, seven two.

1368
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,199
Six, three two.

1369
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:00,199
So if you don't beat that,

1370
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:01,199
you'll be able to beat me.

1371
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,199
I'm going to look at this.

1372
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,199
I'm going to look at this.

1373
00:45:03,199 --> 00:45:04,199
I'm going to look at this.

1374
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:06,199
I'm going to look at this.

1375
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:07,199
Okay, okay, here we go.

1376
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,199
Here we go.

1377
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,199
This is Technically Could Do.

1378
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:10,199
The World Champion.

1379
00:45:10,199 --> 00:45:11,199
Oh!

1380
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,199
Oh!

1381
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:13,199
Oh!

1382
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,199
Oh!

1383
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:15,199
Oh!

1384
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:17,199
Oh!

1385
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:18,199
Oh!

1386
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:19,199
Oh!

1387
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:20,199
Well done.

1388
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:21,199
Valentine's Day.

1389
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,199
Olivia Coleman, what will you be doing on Valentine's Day?

1390
00:45:24,199 --> 00:45:25,199
Oh!

1391
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,199
Err...

1392
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:29,199
Is this about...

1393
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:30,199
Yes.

1394
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:32,199
That would be watching a film.

1395
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:38,199
Your film comes out on February 14th.

1396
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,199
Oh my God, I'm pulling teeth.

1397
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,199
Wait, because I thought you meant...

1398
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,199
Because the perm years before that,

1399
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,199
so I went actually watching on that day,

1400
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,199
I thought you meant, what will I be doing?

1401
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:52,199
I was thinking I'd have to do it.

1402
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:54,199
I thought, don't need, yes, I don't want to do it.

1403
00:45:54,199 --> 00:45:56,199
It's a bit of whimsy, and too much.

1404
00:45:56,199 --> 00:45:57,199
I see, I see.

1405
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:02,199
Well, I'll be sitting with millions of others in his cinema watching my new film, Human Fury.

1406
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,199
So sorry, I see what you did now.

1407
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,199
Yes.

1408
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,199
Thank you.

1409
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,199
No, this is a human fury.

1410
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:11,199
A new British comedy, is yourself a Nick Frost and...

1411
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:12,199
Yeah, I'm not on the poster.

1412
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:13,199
A Chris Addao.

1413
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,199
Oh, well, that isn't you.

1414
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:17,199
But it could be you with a leg in the air.

1415
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:18,199
Yeah.

1416
00:46:18,199 --> 00:46:19,199
Now, I could safely say, ladies and gentlemen,

1417
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:21,199
without fear of contradiction,

1418
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,199
it is the best British-based salsa rom-com

1419
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,199
I have ever seen.

1420
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,199
That can go in the poster, yeah, for sure.

1421
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,199
No, it's a really funny sweet film.

1422
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:34,199
It is a lovely film.

1423
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,199
Now, Ed, who are you?

1424
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:39,199
I can't actually remember the name of my character, but...

1425
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,199
It was a while ago.

1426
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,199
An awesome feature, which was promoting a film.

1427
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:54,199
She didn't know who she was playing in the film.

1428
00:46:54,199 --> 00:46:57,199
It was finished. It was in the cinema.

1429
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,199
It was a long time after we'd filmed it.

1430
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,199
You might have checked before you came on a chat show.

1431
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:06,199
I don't know if you know about her, but she is.

1432
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,199
I have no idea.

1433
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:09,199
I don't know.

1434
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,199
I don't know why this...

1435
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,199
Also, because contractually, no offense,

1436
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,199
but it was sort of asked to come and...

1437
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,199
No, I find that.

1438
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,199
But I love you too.

1439
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:17,199
No, no, no, no.

1440
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,199
Wow.

1441
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:22,199
She doesn't mean that.

1442
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,199
I don't know. I don't know.

1443
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:27,199
She doesn't want to be here, then.

1444
00:47:27,199 --> 00:47:28,199
Oh, no, no, no.

1445
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:30,199
I love Greyham.

1446
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:33,199
But I do wonder why they asked me to do it.

1447
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,199
I don't help. Do I?

1448
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:36,199
You do it.

1449
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:44,199
I assume thinking she's never been one of my thoughts.

1450
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:46,199
Oh, God.

1451
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,199
She's good.

1452
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,199
I like her.

1453
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,199
Thank you.

1454
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,199
Thank you very much.

1455
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:52,199
I like you.

1456
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,199
But you've made a carol, though.

1457
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,199
Hiya.

1458
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:57,199
What's your name?

1459
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:58,199
My name is Eileen.

1460
00:47:58,199 --> 00:47:59,199
Eileen.

1461
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:00,199
Yep.

1462
00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:01,199
I'm guessing you're from Ireland.

1463
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:02,199
I am from Dairy.

1464
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:04,199
We're from Dairy, up to the north of the country.

1465
00:48:04,199 --> 00:48:05,199
Okay. And you live there or here?

1466
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:07,199
I started here. I live over there.

1467
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:08,199
Oh, where? What are you doing?

1468
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:10,199
I'm in a costume design.

1469
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:12,199
A costume interpretation.

1470
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,199
Okay. There will be subtitles on Friday.

1471
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:19,199
I don't know. Right now, only I can understand the memory of it.

1472
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,199
I can't do it.

1473
00:48:20,199 --> 00:48:21,199
Yeah, but I know. I can't.

1474
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:22,199
No.

1475
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,199
So far you're not missing anything.

1476
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,199
I've never heard of costume interpretation before.

1477
00:48:28,199 --> 00:48:30,199
It's that costume design, isn't it?

1478
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,199
It's a fancier.

1479
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:33,199
It's a fancier, Frank.

1480
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,199
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1481
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,199
All the labour.

1482
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,199
Okay. Off you go.

1483
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:42,199
Right. So lead up to Christmas.

1484
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:45,199
I was back home and had a bit more...

1485
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:46,199
Exactly.

1486
00:48:46,199 --> 00:48:47,199
Right.

1487
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:49,199
Did you get any of it?

1488
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:50,199
Christmas. Something about Christmas.

1489
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,199
Yeah, Christmas.

1490
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,199
That's the only good detail so far.

1491
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,199
This pick out words, you'll follow the story.

1492
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,199
Blah blah blah. Christmas.

1493
00:48:57,199 --> 00:48:58,199
Blah blah blah home.

1494
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:03,199
Born into the shop and I had to get milk and bread.

1495
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:12,199
So I literally was really stressed.

1496
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,199
So I was like,

1497
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:15,199
I want to get the groceries.

1498
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:16,199
Let's go.

1499
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:19,199
Told my boyfriend to do a lap and just pick me up.

1500
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:21,199
No need to park the car.

1501
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,199
So as planned, I came out, you know, perfect timing.

1502
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:28,199
I silver people, Carrier.

1503
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:31,199
I just casually drifted by casual speed.

1504
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:33,199
So without hesitation, I sprint across.

1505
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,199
When we look, when we make groceries,

1506
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:38,199
jump in the back of the car, screaming,

1507
00:49:38,199 --> 00:49:40,199
and thump in the back of the chair,

1508
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,199
and I was like,

1509
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:42,199
I'm going to show you this.

1510
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:43,199
Go, go, go, go, go.

1511
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,199
But taking a mind, it was Christmas,

1512
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:47,199
and I had like a scarf up here,

1513
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:48,199
and a hat.

1514
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:51,199
I got, which was my boyfriend,

1515
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:56,199
torn going to be this middle age, like, 60-year-old woman.

1516
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,199
Screamin'.

1517
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,199
Jesus!

1518
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:03,199
I'm pushed or foot on the accelerator.

1519
00:50:03,199 --> 00:50:05,199
I'm just doing a little post.

1520
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:07,199
Oh!

1521
00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:09,199
Good job.

1522
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:10,199
Good job.

1523
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:11,199
Come on, come on, come on.

1524
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:12,199
One of those.

1525
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,199
Very good.
