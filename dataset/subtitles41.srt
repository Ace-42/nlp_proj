1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
Now my girlfriend's here, I'm not licking people's feet.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,400
This is inappropriate.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,200
No, no.

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,240
This is my time with Tony.

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,240
Oh!

6
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,240
Oh!

7
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:20,240
MUSIC

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,480
What a ho ho ho!

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,480
Ha ha!

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,359
That was the biggest mess.

11
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,480
That was the biggest mess?

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,480
Hey.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,480
Is that a candy candy, my pumpkin?

14
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
No, it's a massive erection.

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Massive.

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,480
Massive.

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,480
Massive.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,480
See, Rob?

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
Sure.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

22
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
Ah!

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Oh!

24
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
Shut up, you're international audience.

25
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
You're not fucking anyway.

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,480
It's rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

27
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,480
So that's all Americans.

28
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,480
Shut up, Abby.

29
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480
Oh, Abby.

30
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:50,479
I want you guys.

31
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,479
Do more show.

32
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,479
All right.

33
00:00:52,479 --> 00:01:03,479
My friend came out of the room with tear-as-rolling daddy's face and he said, it's a boy!

34
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,479
We never went back to Thailand after that.

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,479
Oh, no.

36
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,479
That's cute.

37
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,479
That was tiring, I think.

38
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,479
That was tiring.

39
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,479
That was tiring.

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,479
That was tiring.

41
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:16,479
I think I'm tired.

42
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:17,479
That was tiring.

43
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:18,479
That was tiring.

44
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,480
Why did Santa's little helper have depression?

45
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Right.

46
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Because he had low alpha steam.

47
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,480
Oh!

48
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
It's pretty good.

49
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:33,480
I didn't actually know we were doing Christmas Eve stuff, so I was mostly about...

50
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Right.

51
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
Sex stuff.

52
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Oh, my God!

53
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Yeah, a lot of sex offender stuff here.

54
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,480
What about this?

55
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,480
What's Michael Jackson's favorite cat?

56
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
He's always got one.

57
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,480
First, Michael Jackson's favorite fast food.

58
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
What?

59
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,480
KFC.

60
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,480
It's gonna be five years of interest.

61
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,480
That was good.

62
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
How could you do that?

63
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Why did the Christmas decorations have sex?

64
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,480
What?

65
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
Because they were missled toly.

66
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,480
Mmm.

67
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,479
Pretty good.

68
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,479
What's it?

69
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:15,479
Between a lentil and a chickpeat?

70
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:17,479
Oh.

71
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:20,479
You've never had a chickpea on your face.

72
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:22,479
No, I have.

73
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:24,479
I've never had a led to a lot of my face.

74
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,479
Ah, yes!

75
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,479
I've never had a led to a lot of my face.

76
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:30,479
Oh, yes!

77
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,479
I've never had a led to a lot of my face.

78
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,479
Oh, yes!

79
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,479
Ah, yes!

80
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
Ah, yes!

81
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:39,479
Ah, yes!

82
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,479
Ah, yes!

83
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:43,479
Ah, yes!

84
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,479
Ah, yes!

85
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,479
You're the joke, you fucked it up!

86
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,479
Ah, yes!

87
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,479
I couldn't have worked here, I better!

88
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:56,479
He's gonna be a free-yellow out there.

89
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:57,479
Thank you.

90
00:02:57,479 --> 00:02:59,479
Oh, shit.

91
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Cheers.

92
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,479
I'm sounding it out.

93
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,479
To Christmas.

94
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,479
Very Christmas, yes.

95
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,479
What do you call an elf wearing earmuffs?

96
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,479
What?

97
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,479
A c*****.

98
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,479
Relax, he can't hear you.

99
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,479
That's strong.

100
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
Thank you.

101
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,479
Collager.

102
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:28,479
What's the difference between a priest and Woody from Toy Story?

103
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,479
What?

104
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,479
Woody goes limp with a child into the room.

105
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:36,479
Oh, shit.

106
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,479
Oh, shit.

107
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,479
Ah, ha, ha, ha.

108
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:42,479
Ah, ha, ha.

109
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,479
Ah, ha, ha.

110
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:46,479
Ah, ha, ha.

111
00:03:46,479 --> 00:03:48,479
I tried really hard.

112
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:49,479
I thought you laughed on that one.

113
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:50,479
Did you?

114
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,479
I thought I did.

115
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,479
I was the best.

116
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,479
You tried.

117
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,479
That's a good joke.

118
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:01,479
I'm done with the Christmas ones.

119
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:02,479
Oh, thank God.

120
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,479
Now you're gonna go to the funny ones.

121
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,479
Two Christmas crackers.

122
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,479
Oh.

123
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:13,479
What do you call two lesbians in a closet?

124
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:16,480
A liquor cabinet.

125
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,480
That's right.

126
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,480
All right, if we're doing lesbia wads,

127
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,480
why is Drain Johnson the only guy that could turn lesbians?

128
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Because he's a rock.

129
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Because rock bait scissors.

130
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:41,480
There she is.

131
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,480
That's so creepy.

132
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,480
There she is.

133
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,480
Look at that girl.

134
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,480
She's so grown up for a egg.

135
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,480
You're there on Sam's 18th birthday.

136
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
There she is.

137
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
What do you guys do?

138
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Why don't they have toilet paper and KFC?

139
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Why?

140
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,480
Because it's been good looking good.

141
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Oh my god.

142
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Oh, I got one.

143
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Damn, Sammy.

144
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
That's our balance.

145
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
That's good.

146
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
I love our balance.

147
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Like a fortune cookie.

148
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Sam's got some wicked wings.

149
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
They wing arrow.

150
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Why don't women rub their eyes with their wake-up?

151
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Why?

152
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Because they haven't got balls to scratch.

153
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,480

My balls used to be hairier than a gorilla's butt.

158
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
They used to be the Lormaw 5.0 Ultra.

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,480
They're now beautiful and smooth.

160
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I keep asking people to take a look at them.

161
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,480
But nobody wants to.

162
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Sam.

What's a pedophile's favourite type of garden?

176
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Is it okay?

177
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
What?

178
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
A kindergarten.

179
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Oh my god.

180
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Yes, that is good.

181
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
That's good.

182
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,480
That's good.

183
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
That's good.

184
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
That's good.

185
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Slice.

186
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Slice.

187
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Very nice.

188
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,480
We're getting clicked.

189
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,480
You got to fuck that.

190
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Christmas.

191
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Kindergarten.

192
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,480
What's the difference between Neil Armstrong and Michael Jackson?

193
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Oh my god.

194
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and Michael Jackson had sex with children.

195
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I can't look at you.

196
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Oh my god.

197
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Oh my god.

198
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,480
That's so good.

199
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,480
This is one small penis for man.

200
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Oh my god.

201
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Look at me.

202
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,480
But you tell a joke.

203
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Jesus.

204
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
If this one's really bad, can you please cut it up?

205
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Thank you.

206
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,480
How do you know orphan guys aren't gay?

207
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,480
orphan guys?

208
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Because they have no one to call daddy.

209
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh, crossing a line.

210
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
How would that be bad?

211
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,480
That's a really good joke.

212
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:17,480
What vegetable is good for memory?

213
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
What?

214
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Kick up.

215
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Michael stuck wet up my ass and I was sick so I never forgot it.

216
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I thought I was sharing my personal history with you.

217
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,480
It's good to get that out.

218
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,480
Why can't two Chinese people have a white kid?

219
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Oh, what?

220
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Because two wongs don't make a white.

221
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Oh, that's so good.

222
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
That's actually really racist today.

223
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
No, I'm not.

224
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,480
You make it this soon.

225
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You left as well.

226
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Cool.

227
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Tell them to the comments if you're ready.

228
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,480
Seth, you loved that joke.

229
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,480
How can you tell a girl from Tasmania is a virgin?

230
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
How?

231
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,480
She runs faster than her brothers.

232
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,480
We'll set it.

233
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:42,480
How do you circumcise a guy from Tasmania?

234
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
Kick him in the teeth.

235
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
He kicked his sister in the joke.

236
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm making him funny.

237
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
What did you say?

238
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I said my punchlines hit that.

239
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
They did it in my head.

240
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Why do people with foot fetishes never win?

241
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I know.

242
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
Why do people with foot fetishes never win?

243
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Anything.

244
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,480
Why?

245
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,480
Because I like the taste of defeat.

246
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
That's true.

247
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,480
I'll do you lick my foot.

248
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
What?

249
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,480
What are the odds you lick my foot?

250
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
How long are we going to go if I do that?

251
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Do you know how to play that?

252
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,480
You get to choose.

253
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Okay, out of five, I'll count it in.

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay, you ready?

255
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Five, four, three, two, one.

256
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
How to play lick my foot?

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,480
What are the odds?

258
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,480
Yes.

259
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Ods of what?

260
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
You're licking my foot.

261
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,480
If we say the numbers out of five,

262
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,480
we both have to say number from one to five.

263
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,480
I know, but that's the whole point.

264
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,480
What if I win?

265
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,480
How do I win?

266
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I'm really hyped for me to lick your foot.

267
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
No, no, no.

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,480
I'm fighting.

269
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I put down from the foot.

270
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,480
If you get the number right, if we get the number right,

271
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'll lick yours.

272
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Every other number, you have to lick right.

273
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Okay, one in two then.

274
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Oh, you're pretty good.

275
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
All right, you ready?

276
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
No, my girlfriends here.

277
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm not licking people's feet.

278
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,480
All right.

279
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
I did.

280
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
All right.

281
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Okay, fine.

282
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
All right, that's two.

283
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I'll count down from three.

284
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Three, two, one.

285
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Two.

286
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Get it back.

287
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Get it back.

288
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,480
This is not for the content.

289
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,480
I don't know what to say.

290
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,480
People are going to walk to this.

291
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
You have to go on the other side of the table so that she doesn't get it.

292
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Oh, sorry.

293
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
That's the thumbnail.

294
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,480
No, I said, ah!

295
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Just like a rock!

296
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,480
No, no, no, no, no.

297
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Oh, my God.

298
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Oh, my God.

299
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,480
Oh, my God.

300
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,480
It is that to lick the toe.

301
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Yeah.

302
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
It was a lot of tongue.

303
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I feel like things have escalated.

304
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,480
I feel like things have escalated a bit.

305
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
Can we get an employment?

306
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Can we get an employment?

307
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
Okay, okay.

308
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,480
Hold some jokes.

309
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Hold some jokes.

310
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
My way is good.

311
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,480
Guys, we've gone off track.

312
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
We should just get back to what we're all about.

313
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
You know, pitiful jokes.

314
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
Okay.

315
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I can't remember now.

316
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
I think it was your turn, yeah.

317
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Okay.

318
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Knock knock.

319
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,480
Who's there?

320
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
Yoda lady.

321
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Yoda lady, who?

322
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Stop yoda lady.

323
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Hey, got me.

324
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
All right, knock dog joke.

325
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
You're one of those?

326
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,480
Knock knock.

327
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Who's there?

328
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I eat mop.

329
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I eat mop, who?

330
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
You eat your own poo?

331
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,480
That's great.

332
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Oh.

333
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Okay, fair.

334
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I'm sweating up a storm here.

335
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:01,480
What's the difference between Santa and Tiger Woods?

336
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
What?

337
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Santa knew to stop at three hos.

338
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
Okay.

339
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Kids, you were the cheating bastard.

340
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
My girlfriend asked me, have you seen the dog bowl?

341
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I said, I don't even know he played cricket.

342
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,480
I heard that one.

343
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
That's that one.

344
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,480
You guys just want to do that one.

345
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
That's great.

346
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,480
I think people would have liked that one, Matt.

347
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,480
I asked my dad the other day how he felt about abortion,

348
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,480
and he told me to ask my little brother.

349
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,480
I said, I don't have a little brother.

350
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Damn.

351
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,480
You're a trash.

352
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
A trash.

353
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,480
A trash.

354
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
A trash.

355
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
They never go out of stock.

356
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
They never go out of stock today.

357
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Why can't Stevie Wonder see his mates?

358
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Till his blind.

359
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Because he's married.

360
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,480
Because he's black.

361
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,480
Oh no.

362
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,480
He's free.

363
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
Things have gone off the rails.

364
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
Okay.

365
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,480
How does it count like it's state cooked?

366
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
Yeah.

367
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Rare.

368
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Rare.

369
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,480
The silly sounding ones always get me.

370
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Rare.

371
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,480
That's great.

372
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,480
I also loved it.

373
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
You loved it too?

374
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I can't get it on the food thing.

375
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
I need all the information.

376
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,480
What is my asshole?

377
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:18,480
What is my asshole and my Toyota have a common?

378
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
What?

379
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,480
They're both leaking trans food.

380
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Oh my god.

381
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm not a racist.

382
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Can you say that in 2020?

383
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'm not going to tell you.

384
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,480
No.

385
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,480
I'm not going to tell everyone.

386
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,480
That's quite progressive.

387
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Play it.

388
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Play it.

389
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,480
No.

390
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,480
I like it.

391
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Two Indian junkies accidentally.

392
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Can I do that again?

393
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,480
Two Indian junkies?

394
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,480
This one won't make the curve.

395
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,480
Two Indian junkies accidentally snort curry powder.

396
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,480
They both went to hospital one in for a quoma and the other one.

397
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
For a dodgy dickah.

398
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,480
That's pretty good.

399
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,480
That's pretty good.

400
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,480
If I had said that, I would have lost it like you.

401
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,480
You could have a shit.

402
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Fuck.

403
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I thought my hat about a control.

404
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,480
He's in a coma.

405
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Very Christmas.

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Is it any letter from the queen when you turn 100 now you get a text from Prince Andrew when you turn 14?

407
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,480
Oh my god.

408
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,480
Oh my god.

409
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Oh my god.

410
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
Oh my god.

411
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Fuck.

412
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Kill me.

413
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:32,480
God damn it.

414
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,480
No one will help with that.

415
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
That's good dear, right there.

416
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Very Christmas.

417
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Oh yeah.

418
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Fucking blonde.

419
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Why can't Santa have kids of his own?

420
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Because he only comes once a year.

421
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,480
But couldn't he impregnate someone at that one top?

422
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,480
You had one shot.

423
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
Wow.

424
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Would say to capture it.

425
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Flood logic.

426
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,480
No.

427
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I didn't know what to wear to my premature ejaculation society.

428
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,480
So I just came in my pants.

429
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,480
That's really great.

430
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,480
That was hip-sand.

431
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Why are retired Nazis?

432
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Oh that's better.

433
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,480
Why are retired Nazis so good with animals?

434
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Because they're veteran Aryans.

435
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,480
What does she do?

436
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
I get a very...

437
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,480
Like a star sign.

438
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,480
Aryans with a master race.

439
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm an Aryan.

440
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,480
No, no, no, not Aryans.

441
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,480
That was star sign.

442
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,480
I imagine he's like a hero.

443
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Aryan is a star sign.

444
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,480
No, no, no, no.

445
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,480
Did you know it's not nice to laugh loud in Hawaii?

446
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I've said this one before.

447
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
It has to be a low heart.

448
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Were you good then?

449
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
No, I'm just a rational joke.

450
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
What one do you as a original Alan?

451
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,480
She's a bunch of improv.

452
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
We just say do weed accents and try and suck your tongue.

453
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,480
Who makes more money?

454
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:09,480
A drug dealer or a prostitute?

455
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,480
A prostitute?

456
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Because she can wash her crack and reuse it.

457
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,480
I love it, no one's laughing at everyone's clifing.

458
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,480
That's it.

459
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Thank you everyone.

460
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I love it in the morning.

461
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,480
That was good.

462
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,480
What do you call a snowman with a six pack?

463
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,480
The abdominal snowman.

464
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,480
A little bit of web play.

465
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Cute.

466
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,480
What do you call a one-legged Indian man?

467
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,480
What do you call it, Andrew?

468
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
What?

469
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
I hate that I love that.

470
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
What do you call a one-legged Indian man?

471
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Balancing.

472
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Shout out to our massive Indian fan base.

473
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,480
We love you guys.

474
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,480
There we are.

475
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,480
I won.

476
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,480
I won.

477
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,480
I've got a loss.

478
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
You're ahead of a loss.

479
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,480
What was the score?

480
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
11 or 8.

481
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,480
I won.

482
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
It's not saying.

483
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Very Christmas.
