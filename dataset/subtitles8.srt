1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,640
Things happen to you.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:05,360
Like, is it your house in near Dover?

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,640
Oh, yes.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,640
Yes.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm glad you brought that up because I do rent my house.

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,640
I'm glad you're here.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,280
If you're interested. Two other people.

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,719
I mean, two other people.

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:18,960
And it's the nearest house to France,

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,240
which is very important in this story.

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,920
And it's 425 pounds a week.

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,719
And it sleeps.

13
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:27,000
It sleeps.

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,320
It sleeps people for four, seven nights.

15
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,519
It's clean. It's very cleaner.

16
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:31,560
Yes, yes.

17
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,159
Anyway, one day I got a call from the police

18
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,039
and they said, are you the owner of the gun in placement?

19
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,439
And I said, yes.

20
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,079
And they said, are you aware that it's been used

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,719
as a drop for criminals to get rid of their drugs?

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,240
Or, you know, it's a drug drop.

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,439
I believe that's the phrase.

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,439
And I said, well, of course I didn't know what do you mean.

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,519
And they said, well, people have rented it.

26
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:05,920
They were a gang, a gang from Liverpool, I think.

27
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,480
And they took my house and they dropped the drugs in the bay.

28
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,959
Or they, and there was a helicopter that came on the roof.

29
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:18,959
It's a flat roof, yes.

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:21,200
And they had cocaine.

31
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,759
They had 30, something like 13 million pounds worth of money.

32
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,599
What? No, no, it wasn't like a little thing.

33
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,599
This was a massive thing.

34
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:30,599
What?

35
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:31,839
30 million.

36
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,319
Jesus Christ.

37
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,079
I'm so fucking insane.

38
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,079
Of cocaine.

39
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,679
That is actually...

40
00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:38,679
That was freaking hard.

41
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:39,519
No, I don't...

42
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:41,919
Oh, not super-no. That was like wholesale.

43
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,399
Oh, wholesale?

44
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:44,439
Listen, I'm...

45
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,679
It's wholesale.

46
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,679
Oh.

47
00:01:47,679 --> 00:01:50,280
Well, of course I was horrified because I didn't know.

48
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,159
I mean, I don't have anything to do with the people

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
that rent it.

50
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:54,679
I just take the money, you know?

51
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:55,679
Yeah.

52
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:56,679
I need to go more.

53
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,080
And I was... Well, I could get more for it

54
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,920
because it's really lovely actually.

55
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,680
That's all that...

56
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,480
But what's upsetting, Mummy, was when it was reported, of course,

57
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
in the Daily Mail,

58
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,760
all the people online said,

59
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,760
oh, she must be in it.

60
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,760
You know, she's part of the gang.

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,760
Oh, no.

62
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,760
They were calling me Miriam Escobar.

63
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,120
I'm back for a Western.

64
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,120
I mean, we see Tom Hanks gun-token, which we rarely see.

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,520
Well, I don't have...

66
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,520
I don't wear one.

67
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,159
I am given one later on.

68
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,760
So it's not like, you know, I'm not doing the root and toot

69
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,760
and kind of...

70
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,760
But I ride a horse and I drive a wagon and I've discovered...

71
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,120
So I'm not a rider per se, but I did learn.

72
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,120
I had a fabulous...

73
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,200
Got to know a fabulous whore named Wimpy,

74
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
who was my horse.

75
00:02:56,199 --> 00:03:00,199
And I don't know if anybody here has written a lot

76
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:03,199
or made a Western Emily has a couple of Westerns

77
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,799
under her belt, as I recall.

78
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,799
Emily, my darling, how are you?

79
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:07,799
How for you?

80
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:08,799
Wonderful to see you.

81
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,799
It's good to see you.

82
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:10,799
Emily Glunt.

83
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,799
Do you know what I'm about to do a Western?

84
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:15,799
Like, next year, I'm doing a six-part Western

85
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,799
and we were just discussing how allergic I am to horses

86
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,599
and I do every scene with a horse, you know.

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to be anti-histamine up to my eyeball.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Do you have to kiss the horses and make those noises?

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Doesn't that...

90
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Isn't that what happens in Westerns to make out with your horse?

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You develop an affection for those beasts.

92
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You and Wimpy.

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You and Wimpy...

94
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're kind of with...

95
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Every morning you throw your arms around Wimpy,

96
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
say, how are you, my darling, little chestnut?

97
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So do you nuts about you?

98
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Which you sort of have to do because I have a feeling

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
that horses, honestly, they would much rather live in a world

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
without human beings climbing on top, though.

101
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And they know the moment you climb on their back

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
that you're terrible at riding.

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I mean, I've been learning right now,

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm in London now rehearsing for it,

105
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and I go riding three times a week

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
and every time they give me a different horse

107
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to see how you fare with one that's more slightly

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
or one that's less of a Ferrari.

109
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And I got on one of the other day called Rusty.

110
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, my God!

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It almost took off with me. It was terrifying.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I couldn't walk the next day. Rusty did me in.

113
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Rusty did me in. Rusty did me in.

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, wow. Is that the name of the film?

115
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's what it is.

116
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Oh, my God.

117
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There is...no, of course, this isn't the spotter.

118
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But so there are, you know, there are set-tos,

119
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
you have some touchy moments and words,

120
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and I'm seeing them, can I?

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But can we talk about the sex scene?

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's one of the best sex scenes I've seen.

123
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I've seen it.

124
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I think talk about the sex scene.

125
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's one of the best sex scenes I've seen in forever.

126
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
That sex scene.

127
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who put that to go?

128
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yo, seriously.

129
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh.

130
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No, it's not.

131
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not like they're kind of like prancing around naked.

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's just, it's a really clever...

133
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who put...do you guys put that together?

134
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did we just go up, put it together?

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, we had nothing to do with that.

136
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Excuse me, I'm just starting over my universe over here.

137
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And of course, it's not just you in it.

138
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Other screen legends, Jeremy Iron.

139
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
He didn't the sex scene?

140
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, I'm seeing it.

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Jeremy.

142
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Jeremy was in a...

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Jeremy was particularly.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He was great.

145
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He was buying the camera.

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Why are you having sex?

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm trying to tell.

148
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This is a breakthrough role for you, Jack,

149
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because an American accent?

150
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

151
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes.

152
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Is doing an American accent?

153
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What, in that clip?

154
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Yes.

155
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Lydia!

156
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He was.

157
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Was.

158
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I feel the Oscar bars pissing away.

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, no.

160
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He's so serious.

161
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, it was good.

162
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It was good.

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I heard it.

164
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You see, not a lot of actors do when they're doing American accent.

165
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
They tend to just go for one region of America

166
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
and they commit to a single American accent.

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I decided with this role that I would take on a tour around all 50 states.

168
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sometimes in the same scene.

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I thought, why just do one when you can show off them all?

170
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So I would start the scene talking like I was from New York

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
and then over with Sudden, I'm suddenly speaking like I'm a calligirl

172
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
and by the end of the scene they're stopping me

173
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
because it sounds like I'm from the Duke's a hazard.

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I went all over the place.

175
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But I thought, you know, just show off your skills.

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You were a bartender.

177
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I just love that you would be such a good bartender, Marker Fluff.

178
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Thank you.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
A generous...

180
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know, he'd do a generous pour.

181
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He would always do a generous pour, Marker Fluff.

182
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I would do a generous...

183
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's hard.

184
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mostly because people would be like, come on, man.

185
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Really?

186
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But nobody didn't eat you. How do you own cocktail?

187
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I had the Marker Rita.

188
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
LAUGHTER

189
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And where's the gum and gruffalo, but no.

190
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Marker Rita.

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But I ended up having, you know, I'd start early

192
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and I'd had my Thursday night crowd, partially,

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
because... And I'm sorry, Sean McPherson, wherever you are.

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I gave away a lot of free drinks.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It wasn't a great quality in a bartender.

196
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
But you were good dealing with drunk customers, which is...

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I had the deal with a lot of drunk customers.

198
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Which is...

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I had the deal with a lot of drunk people, yes.

200
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And sometimes they were not very nice.

201
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, no.

202
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There would be nights where I'd be up to my eyeballs and a-holes.

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm saying nothing.

204
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
LAUGHTER

205
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Do you like your wine?

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't know what it's called.

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What did I say?

208
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Nothing.

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Is that a spoiler?

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No!

211
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's nothing!

212
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Marble, you're boring!

213
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, you went...

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh!

215
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So, no, wasn't there a guy who wanted a...

216
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Wasn't there a drunk guy?

217
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh, I get it!

218
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yeah!

219
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
LAUGHTER

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
APPLAUSE

221
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Wasn't there a drunk guy?

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Wasn't that kind of bar?

223
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wasn't there a drunk guy who wanted a...

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A book?

225
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes, there was.

226
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay, tell us about him.

227
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So, occasionally, you would get someone who was so obnoxious

228
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and it was the end of the night and this guy came in.

229
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And he's like, I don't know.

230
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And he was wasted and he was such an a-hole.

231
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And he's like, I want a Zambooker.

232
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm like, come on, man.

233
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You're doing okay.

234
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're like, give me a Zambooker.

235
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And...

236
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did he hit his knee like that?

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, I thought...

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Give me a Zambooker.

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm like, okay, so I pour him a Zambooker.

240
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Late it!

241
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm not gonna let you drink, man.

242
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I don't like drinks.

243
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, you want to let you drink?

244
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You let you drink yourself.

245
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Late it!

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Okay.

247
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I like the drink.

248
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He takes it.

249
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And it goes all over his face,

250
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
dripping down his face,

251
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
and he's like, you've been through flames everywhere.

252
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I'm trying not to laugh.

253
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And he...

254
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He beats the hell out of himself to get it out.

255
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Give me another!

256
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, sure thing.

257
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You want me to light it for you?

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yes!

259
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Same thing all over me.

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It was one of the greatest nights.

261
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I sort of like him for having another one.

262
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I love him.

263
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,000
He walked out with like a flaming red goat.

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
That brings back a really painful memory.

265
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It was you?

266
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
No.

267
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Well...

268
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
That was amazing.

269
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I was like 12, 13.

270
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I was a late bloomer,

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
but I had a premature mustache.

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Like I had hair there and nowhere else, right?

273
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean, my head, of course.

274
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And I was begging my dad,

275
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
because kids were making fun of me.

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Like, oh, you're stash, swimmer, you're moustache.

277
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And so I was begging my dad, hey, can I please shave?

278
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And my dad was like, you're too young to shave, I'm sorry.

279
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But I was...

280
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I took matters into my own hand.

281
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
And I borrowed some of my sister's nair.

282
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh, no.

283
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And for those of you who don't know, it's like a chemical hair removal.

284
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's a...

285
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We got an imac.

286
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay, so I put it on my lip,

287
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
but I left it on too long.

288
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So I had a burn mark.

289
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Just like that.

290
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I had to then go to school,

291
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and everyone knew I had tried,

292
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and then I'd take my hair off,

293
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
and they're like, what the...

294
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So all these other names,

295
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
so I'm sorry to bring up.

296
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We'll give that a trauma, but I want to share that.

297
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Very good.

298
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't you talk to someers

299
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
and tell you how your height difference

300
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
makes those stunts more complicated?

301
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I can't keep going.

302
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I didn't say it. It's a day of sitting.

303
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That is a good story.

304
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's a good story.

305
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Well, you see, there's a particular stunt.

306
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't know if it's in this, but there's a...

307
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He, Spider-Man, swings us on top of a bridge,

308
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and he places me there.

309
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's the bridge.

310
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Yeah, that's the bridge.

311
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
We eventually jump off of that screaming.

312
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's right.

313
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
So he's supposed to gently, you know,

314
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
rest MJ on the bridge and walk away from her.

315
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Because of our height difference, I obviously...

316
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If we're on the same...

317
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Yes, we were attached.

318
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We were attached. I would land before him.

319
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Because my feet obviously hit the ground before he does.

320
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
So...

321
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What would happen?

322
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, it's called a bottom mark, isn't it?

323
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And the bottom mark is to basically...

324
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's a thing that they do in stunts

325
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that is basically designed to stop you shattering your kneecaps.

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, yeah.

327
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So, Zendaya would land, and I'm the superhero.

328
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm supposed to look cool.

329
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And she would land, and then I would sort of land like this,

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
and my feet would swing from underneath me,

331
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
and then she would catch me.

332
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
And then you'd like to...

333
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh, I'm not doing that.

334
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You're actually very, very lovely about it.

335
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
And you were like, oh, my gosh, thank you.

336
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's something nice to be caught for a change.

337
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
We're full of us.

338
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
We're full of us.
