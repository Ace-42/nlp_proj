1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I think you're gonna use mouth and get a pump and down on this.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're gonna actually fix it.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You gotta erase that.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You mean?

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're gonna erase that.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey buddy.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
How are you?

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
It's been a while.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm good.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah?

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Is that how usual way of saying hello, isn't it?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hello.

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's good to see you, man.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Likewise.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What's been going on?

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Um, I don't know.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Not much.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm running.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Sumo.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
How's that going?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's going well.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's going fine.

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah.

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm wearing polar shirts now.

26
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It looks great.

27
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It looks exciting.

28
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Thank you.

29
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Thank you.

30
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Digging the vibe.

31
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Digging the look.

32
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Digging.

33
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What are you up to?

34
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just bring it back.

35
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Anyway, let's get on to the segment.

36
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, good chat.

37
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Move on to the segment.

38
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Um, would you like to start?

39
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I would love to begin.

40
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'd love to begin.

41
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Please tell me a joke.

42
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
How are you?

43
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
How are you?

44
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not tall enough.

45
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
You're a bit too weak.

46
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
That's my...

47
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, change...

48
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, okay.

49
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Tristan, my public is...

50
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I changed.

51
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Whoa!

52
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You changed.

53
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You've got famous?

54
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

55
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What, um, life's about change.

56
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Life's about change, pal.

57
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Mmm.

58
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Life's about change.

59
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What do my ex-girlfriend

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and a public toilet

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
have in common?

62
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What?

63
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Um, they're both usually busy

64
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and full of shit.

65
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
All right.

66
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's Michael Jackson's favorite painting?

67
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I could probably guess this one if I tried.

68
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Van Gogh.

69
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a monochleeta.

70
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, no.

71
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How many of these do you have?

72
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Hundreds.

73
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Pages.

74
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How did the TikTokers pay for their rent?

75
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, by explaining this video is sponsored by Surfsharp.

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It keeps your personal data protected

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
from online criminals and big companies.

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A VPN makes sure that your city, country, and download history

79
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
aren't attached to your identity.

80
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And that's important in this day and age.

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Surfsharp's CleanWeb feature blocks ads, stops malware,

82
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and keeps track of fishing attempts against you,

83
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
which means it's looking out for your best interest.

84
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But Alan, what if I'm on holiday?

85
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Shut up.

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Doesn't matter about that.

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can change your geographical location back to your home country

88
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
so you can keep up with the movies and TV shows that you enjoy.

89
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
That's amazing.

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah.

91
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Surfsharp offers a 30-day cashback guarantee,

92
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
which means there's no risk in trying.

93
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You could do so much in 30 days.

94
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You could watch every episode of Love Island.

95
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And I, that's what I do every day.

96
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Surfsharp offers a 30-day cashback guarantee,

97
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
which means you can try it and test it.

98
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And if you don't like it, you can get your money back off the 30 days.

99
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Use promo code, you're mad for three months for free.

100
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What's more than three for three months?

101
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're getting me? What the heck?

102
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Hit that link down below.

103
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
They say 9 out of 10 people suffer from diarrhea.

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I guess that makes me number 10 because I love it.

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What do you call it when two transgender b****s have sex?

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Uh...

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

108
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Micro-transact.

109
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I don't even get any more understand of that one.

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Oh, all right.

111
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought that was quite good.

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Pull you off the booze.

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, I mean...

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm an artist.

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I went for a walk with a girl the other day.

116
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hey, man.

117
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry.

118
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Well, he's right.

119
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's tighter as a walk until she saw me in the bushes.

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then it became around, run.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And it became around.

122
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It became around.

123
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
If you tell him what?

124
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Around.

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Around.

126
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
All right.

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Have you got what?

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why is China bad at football?

129
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Why?

130
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Because every time they get a corner, they open a restaurant.

131
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You know, like...

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Chinese restaurants.

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Do the accent.

134
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Do the accent.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Reach a corner.

136
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, you're...

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You're the only one.

138
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're the only one.

139
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You did the team.

140
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No.

141
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
No, the one.

142
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
No.

143
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Not the one.

144
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I hope you guys know that you're creating a culture of racial division.

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yes.

146
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I was at the dentist the other day.

147
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And the dentist said, oh, this is going to sting.

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And I said, okay, go ahead.

149
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And he says, you're a fat loser.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is that...

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Have you just modified one of your bits?

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No.

153
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, I just kind of like that bit.

154
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
That's how the bit I had.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Have you said that movie where Johnny Depp gets molested?

156
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No.

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's called Who's Eating Gilbert's Date?

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He wrote that.

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I thought it was a part of the Caribbean.

160
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Like the Caribbean...

161
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Oh, that's a big sense.

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, that doesn't make sense.

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I thought it was called the fear and molesting.

164
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He molested you.

165
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I wanted to just do an hour of that.

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I think I'm a cop.

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I thought it was called...

168
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Amber heard something.

169
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But what's the difference between a hormone and a vitamin?

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, what?

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You can't hear a vitamin.

172
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, I got that fear.

173
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, that hurts.

174
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I feel it.

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
That's good.

177
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yeah, because you can hear a hormone.

178
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yeah, well, we're going to work on our chemistry.

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What do you call a Chinese guy with a camera?

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm not a Ching Chong, right?

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What?

182
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What are you calling?

183
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Filming!

184
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh!

185
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's not a snapper.

186
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's not a Godzilla.

187
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Dude, that's racist.

188
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
They can't say L.

189
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Filming.

190
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
When...

191
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Continue.

192
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Fuck it.

193
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Um...

194
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hey.

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Homo...

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, hey.

197
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Give me a joke.

198
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The dude should do ASMR.

199
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Give me a joke.

200
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Did you know...

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Homo was so... was in... was...

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The other day, I saw a stop sign, a road sign.

203
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let me do that again.

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
One time, I saw a sign that said, watch for children.

205
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
And I thought to myself,

206
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Huh, that's a good deal.

207
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
So I traded in my Rolex,

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
and now I get free iPhones and Jordans at home.

209
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Because the children make them...

210
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
to... to joke about the child labor state.

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Say the child labor of the man.

212
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
That's the real thing, yeah.

213
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh.

214
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You're a pedagogy.

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This one will never make the...

216
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm disappointed.

217
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm disappointed.

218
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My girlfriend told me to stop singing,

219
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm a believer, or she dumped me.

220
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I thought she was joking.

221
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah.

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But then I saw her face.

223
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And I'm a believer.

224
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm not good at finding the clitoris.

225
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm just joking.

226
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Probably because I don't belong in the hood.

227
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That was bad.

228
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It didn't belly button.

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And what?

230
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ellen, would you believe the doctor told me I had to stop masturbating?

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I said, why doctor?

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
And he said, because I'm trying to examine you.

233
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh.

234
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's just like the first joke that pops up when you Google down jokes.

235
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's just a joke.

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Zero or all?

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
When Hammer was in prison,

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
he used to put butt, used to pour butter on all the bars of soap.

239
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So people would drop them more when in the shower.

240
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
There's a dirty little freak.

241
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Isn't soap already separate?

242
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yeah, but you met at Atrice Lippurit.

243
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You said it would constantly drop.

244
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, okay.

245
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's what you do.

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You're a slippery guy.

247
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You're a manipulative fucking.

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're a shit.

249
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm ungrateful little freak.

250
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh!

251
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm agent.

252
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now I feel like I'm a...

253
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm a doctor's masturbating.

254
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I like...

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Shut the fuck up, Ellen.

256
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Why are chickens so funny?

257
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Why?

258
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Um...

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, I know that one.

260
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's the...

261
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think I was gonna do that.

262
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, because they make good jokes.

263
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No, can you not trample on my fucking punch lines?

264
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, fucking dickhead.

265
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is why I didn't want to work with him today?

266
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Fucking hell.

267
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
All right, I tell you, stupid fucking robot.

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm trying to have fun.

269
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You're not...

270
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
It's kind of your fault that it's not going well.

271
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Fuck off.

272
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh, fuck.

273
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What?

274
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I wanted to say something.

275
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I wanted to stop looking at something.

276
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You did it.

277
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You did some good jokes or what?

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Fuck me.

279
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I was talking to fucking software.

280
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Fuck you.

281
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Stop.

282
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Stop.

283
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was just joking.

284
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I was just joking.

285
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I was just joking.

286
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It was a fun hit.

287
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yeah, it was a fun hit.

288
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, it was a fun hit.

289
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It's not.

290
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yeah, I still work non-stop.

291
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why are chickens so funny?

292
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why?

293
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Why?

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Because!

295
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

296
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Nice.

297
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm so confused.

298
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's too...

299
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What?

300
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's dead, I'm just moving back together.

301
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I still don't know if I'm attracted to the hammer world.

302
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What the hell?

303
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What the hell?

304
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're like, I'm a man.

305
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Love you, Syracuse.

306
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

307
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Are you a pothole?

308
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
That was great, I think.

309
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I was like, fuck you.

310
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm a bit scared.

311
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I was mad at you.

312
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I was like, fuck you.

313
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let's go!

314
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think it's your turn.

315
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's funny, Steve.

316
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I just wanted to know, I wasn't going to talk to him once I started doing this.

317
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just make sure that.

318
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The cat says otherwise, I mean.

319
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hammer's new special, it should be called Oranges the New Hack.

320
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's a good idea.

321
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
That's a good idea.

322
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That's a good idea.

323
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
That was better than any of your roast jokes to get the killer.

324
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You lost his wall pal.

325
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Yeah, the user that says otherwise.

326
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I guess it should be kissing makeup.

327
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

328
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Are you tracking down?

329
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh.

330
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah.

331
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
What's that, Rayby?

332
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What's that?

333
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It's called Taking Charge.

334
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What about this?

335
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is what disillite in the mood.

336
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I suggested to my wife that she looks sexy with her hair back.

337
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh.

338
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Apparently, that's incisited to say to someone during chemo.

339
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, fuck.

340
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
She doesn't whip that hair back and forth.

341
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Cancer does.

342
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
It's the same joke that he told.

343
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
To reminisce about prison,

344
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hammer sometimes does an escape room,

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
while being angly penetrated by the security guard.

346
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Just to reminisce.

347
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Did you find these on the internet or did you write these on the road?

348
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah, I could tell.

349
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because they're good.

350
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How can you tell if your wife is dead?

351
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I don't know how.

352
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The sex is the same, but the dishes start to pile up.

353
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, God.

354
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know, learning the dishwasher or whatever.

355
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's pretty nice.

356
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That's good gear.

357
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I don't use dishes. I just get taken out.

358
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Hammer is so fat, not even door ought to explore him.

359
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
That's a child, cousin.

360
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When you were a regular heavy 32,

361
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
these are those jokes.

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is not good.

363
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Me as well.

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Here we go.

365
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Self-chop.

366
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
That's so much.

367
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And the shot is actually more intense.

368
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Just a fella.

369
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
That's how it goes.

370
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
That's how it goes.

371
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're up.

372
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Alex.

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Come back to us.

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
He's drooling.

375
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Would you like a tissue?

376
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

377
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Good thing it's good and free.

378
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
How about you?

379
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Where's the bottom?

380
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You put your finger in his mouth and get him on this.

381
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You got to raise it up.

382
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh my God.

383
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Holy shit.

384
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Holy shit.

385
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Holy shit.

386
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wow, Nikki eats a lot of pineapple.

387
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Oh my God.

388
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
That's so much.

389
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's so good.

390
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Guys, can we just get back to the jugs?

391
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
This is it.

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Fuck, get that.

393
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It's a lot of pineapple.

394
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
It's supposed to be about the jugs.

395
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Another one.

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm gonna get it.

397
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
You didn't even finish your last shot.

398
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I know.

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Don't hold them though.

400
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Oh my God.

401
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Is it my joke?

402
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
How many feminists does it take to change a light bulb?

403
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I don't know.

404
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Don't be stupid.

405
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Feminists can't change anything.

406
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Am I right?

407
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We should ask our local feminists.

408
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What do you think about that?

409
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's the difference between a rock star and a gynecologist?

410
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
A rock star fucks his singers while a gynecologist sucks his fingers.

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I give you love, I love it.

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I give you love that one.

413
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:18,000
We need to get away from all the skills jokes.

414
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
As before I saw these jokes.

415
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
These are amazing football jokes.

416
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Did you know that black holes are billions of years old?

417
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Amazingly, some of the black holes Stephen Hawking studied were only 14 years old.

418
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh my Lord Jesus.

419
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
This is a pedophile.

420
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm not a pedophile.

421
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We just got an additional camera.

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Glad joke was done.

423
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Why did the seamen cross the road?

424
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Because I put on the wrong socks this morning.

425
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You can look at me when you tell the joke.

426
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
No, it's just too embarrassing.

427
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Who's there?

428
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Quiet horse.

429
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Quiet horse who?

430
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
That's great.

431
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Did you write that one?

432
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I'm not saying I'm not saying good.

433
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I'm not saying good.

434
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm not saying good.

435
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm not saying good.

436
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
In betray day, neck or pedophile.

437
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
We like to just do a little actual dad joke.

438
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Just to give him a guess.

439
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've actually had a pretty good day so far.

440
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I got working up with a blowjob this morning.

441
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Crashly.

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you.

443
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's probably actually the last time I slept on the park again.

444
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Wow, if I didn't fuck up the wording.

445
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Yeah, it was the wording.

446
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The wording got you.

447
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Park was my cousin's name.

448
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Actually, that was Lee Sun Park.

449
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Oh, yeah.

450
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
You might know this guy's about what do you call a Chinese guy with one leg?

451
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Limping.

452
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Taiwan shoe.

453
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Free Taiwan baby.

454
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Wow, political.

455
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm a political guy now.

456
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I once asked my dad, how do I spell penis?

457
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He said, oh, Sun, you should've asked me last night.

458
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I had one to tip my tongue.

459
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Tell me you something else.

460
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You have the jokes about your dad touching you, don't you?

461
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not freaking him.

462
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, bad out.

463
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Bad out.

464
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh, what?

465
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:41,000
For anyone who missed that, I'll just broke the chair by being fat.

466
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Oh, my God.

467
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Oh.

468
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh.

469
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You've got an sour.

470
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
You've got weird hours has arrived.

471
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Yeah.

472
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah.

473
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Your name is Wobbles, you better run.

474
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, my God.

475
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, my God.

476
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Oh, my God.

477
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Oh.

478
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
What is he?

479
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Can we call that from the tape, please?

480
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm so sorry.

481
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Is it my time?

482
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
This is why the easy mutation dad joke channels can't date us because of the weirdness.

483
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
You think it's just about telling jokes, no.

484
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's about fun and soft.

485
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's about me and we.

486
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
All right, what about this?

487
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You know the people in Dubai don't like the floodstones?

488
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Yeah, why is that?

489
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
But the people in Abbey, Dabbey, do.

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Tell you what, that joke was rock bottom.

491
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,000
What's the hardest part about eating a vegetable?

492
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What?

493
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
The taste and then putting it back in the wheelchair.

494
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Maybe I'll regret saying that tomorrow.

495
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Do you know that my siblings had,

496
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
is that all the Chinese 100 people's siblings?

497
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
No, that's racist, dude.

498
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
What are you talking about?

499
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You know my sibling had gender affirming surgery and now reads the news on today FM broadcast.

500
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Talk about transistor radio.

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wow, you really have a knack of playing with words amazing.

502
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I really enjoyed being read it, put word by word just to make sure you got the language correctly.

503
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Today is forever.

504
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What's...

505
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You mean?

506
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
FM sounds like the choice they're given on the form.

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What's the difference?

508
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
What's the difference?

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It's me!

510
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
It's a Spanish spine.

511
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Did you actually fall?

512
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What?

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,000
He did fall, it smells like prison officers penis.

514
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm clutty, what's the difference between three dicks and a joke?

515
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Tell me.

516
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Andrew's mother can't take a joke.

517
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
She can take three dicks.

518
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
She's a fucking ski-sie little whore.

519
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Are you serious?

520
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
She's a dirty bird, your mother.

521
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's like one of the most viral clips I've ever had.

522
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh, is it?

523
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Am I in it?

524
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You were in the video.

525
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Diffin' Abby. Are you serious?

526
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
That's what my family's for.

527
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, that's the different Abby joke.

528
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I don't know, I don't watch the videos.

529
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I don't watch the videos.

530
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I don't watch the sound of this at all in fact.

531
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I just skip to my jokes and then I skip the rest.

532
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I should do another one though.

533
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Yeah, do another one because that one was dog shit.

534
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
They're all dog shit.

535
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Okay, how about this one?

536
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Did you know that Jack the Ripper, after being caught for his crimes, escaped and moved to Melbourne, Australia?

537
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Did you guys know that?

538
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I didn't know that, tell me more.

539
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Well, at first I was surprised until I realized it's in his name.

540
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
He's Jack the Ripper.

541
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What?

542
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You trust a lot.

543
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Someone should rip me apart.

544
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Like the...

545
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Did you even get that joke?

546
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
A Ripper is like what you call a Australian colloquialism.

547
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, but why not?

548
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
He's a Ripper.

549
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
We smell them, he's like the most like...

550
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
He's like, let's do it.

551
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
This happened in the 1800s when they went their culture.

552
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We call it like kind of this kind of strippers, guy the ribbers?

553
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
I don't know.

554
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
I have to do what I have to do.

555
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I have to do a telejoy.

556
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Alright.

557
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Alright, yeah, yeah.

558
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
He's where I write myself.

559
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Yeah!

560
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Andrew!

561
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Alright.

562
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What?

563
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Alright, here's the original.

564
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Ready?

565
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
What did the Terminator say at the grocery store

566
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
when someone asked for help finding the milk?

567
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What?

568
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll be back.

569
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh!

570
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Oh!

571
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Oh!

572
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
That's a pretty lunch.

573
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Tell me, girl, baby.

574
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh, well, well, well, what does the whorny frog say?

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Rob it.

576
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Rob it.

577
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Boo!

578
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
That's about your dad's side to get deep in.

579
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh my god.

580
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We discovered that everyone's better with that one though.

581
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What do you get when you mix up...

582
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
...brown chicken and a brown cow.

583
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
What?

584
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Brown chicken, brown cow.

585
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
That's pretty good.

586
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
That's not the answer.

587
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
That's not the answer.

588
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Sorry, sorry.

589
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

590
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,000
We're laughing at your double allegations, pal.

591
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh my god.

592
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
What's the difference between Wuhan and Vegas?

593
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

594
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Good for you.

595
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's a rude one.

596
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, when he sweated it off again, you get it.

597
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
What has two legs and bleeds?

598
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
What?

599
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Half a dog.

600
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Jesus.

601
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
No, what?

602
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
He's so...

603
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
He's so funny.

604
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Uh, Jada.

605
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Sleepy Joe, sleepy Joe.

606
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Why is a threesome...

607
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Why is a threesome with two Thai girls...

608
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
...like Wendy Mulanari?

609
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Why?

610
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Because he's smashing balls.

611
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I want you to drink that and I want you to think about what you've done today.

612
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
That's it, right?

613
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Better ending.

614
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
What do you think is gonna be a better ending?

615
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's great ending.

616
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Turn me off.

617
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Oh.

618
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Oh my god.

619
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Oh my god.
