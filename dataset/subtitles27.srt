1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
Then this is the most ideal you ever had.

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,879
Let's go.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:05,120
Is it a camera's ready?

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,120
Let's go.

5
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:06,719
Ah!

6
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:07,719
Ah!

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,839
I love it!

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,519
It'll take a few hours.

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:23,519
That's awesome!

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,199
You made it!

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:25,199
You finally made it.

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,359
Finally, finally.

13
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,679
Yeah, isn't it good?

14
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,320
Yeah.

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,199
Oh, why?

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,199
Hey everyone!

17
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,200
I'll say it in half a cup.

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,200
Yeah, if you know this is Timmy, he's actually part of the cast.

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
I think it's part of the couch, wasn't it?

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Yeah, couch.

21
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah.

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
How's it feeling?

23
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
It's not feeling good.

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
You excited?

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Yeah, glad to finally be here.

26
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
Oh!

27
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,200
I'm so excited to be here too.

28
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Do you want to do a season of savorov?

29
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
Yeah, let's go.

30
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,200
This looks like the most old-looking date of it.

31
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,200
Yeah!

32
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
It looks like a normal date.

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Who might be more?

34
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Just how do you be?

35
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Sizzes, paper, rock.

36
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh!

37
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Oh!

38
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
Oh!

39
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Okay, I think you should go first.

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Oh, sure.

41
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,200
Oh, okay.

42
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Oh!

43
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,200
What do you call a blonde during a handstand?

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,200
What?

45
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,200
A brunette with bad breath.

46
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
This is currently so bad.

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,200
I don't get it either.

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,200
It's because of the dryness and the oils.

49
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Oh, like, grove.

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh, I got that either.

51
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,200
Are you loving?

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Oh, shit.

53
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:52,200
I just want to say, if I don't win this, I'm embarrassing.

54
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Oh, you shaking?

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,200
Yeah.

56
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Oh, he's shaking.

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Well, it's fucking weird.

58
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Cheers.

59
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Cheers.

60
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
That's not too big.

61
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Yeah.

62
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,200
They all can't be bangers, mate.

63
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
No.

64
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,199
But please, make one of the best.

65
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,199
What disease do you get from having sex in a gym?

66
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,199
Don't know.

67
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,199
Ferbys.

68
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,199
Yeah.

69
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,199
Hmm.

70
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,199
I thought you were going to love for that one.

71
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,199
No.

72
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,199
Okay.

73
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:24,199
All right.

74
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:27,199
Why is parking a car like finding a girlfriend?

75
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,199
Why?

76
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,199
All the good ones are taken.

77
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:34,199
So you just stick it in the disabled one and hope no one finds out.

78
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,199
Ah!

79
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:39,199
Oh, shit.

80
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,199
Oh, shit.

81
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,199
I think it's so true.

82
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,199
Oh, that's a good idea.

83
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,199
That's a good idea.

84
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,199
That's a good idea.

85
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,199
Oh, he's in the game.

86
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,199
Oh, my God.

87
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:59,199
He's like, he's like, coffee disabled sports today.

88
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,199
Oh, my God.

89
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:01,199
All right.

90
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:02,199
You love it?

91
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,199
Cheers, Timmy.

92
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:04,199
I'm laughing.

93
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,199
What?

94
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,199
What?

95
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,199
What?

96
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,199
What?

97
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,199
What?

98
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,199
Oh, my God.

99
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:11,199
That's a fucking shit, guys.

100
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:13,199
Yeah, I know that happens to me the first time.

101
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,199
You have to, like, not laugh.

102
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,199
Yeah.

103
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:20,199
Yeah, like, that's the point, right?

104
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,199
Yeah.

105
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,199
It's like tweet or D and tweet or dumb.

106
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,199
Fucking shit.

107
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:30,199
What a pre-sale to get rid of flies in church.

108
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:33,199
Let us spray.

109
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,199
It's gonna be.

110
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:39,199
It's gonna be.

111
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,199
Hmm.

112
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,199
Oh.

113
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:42,199
Oh, my God.

114
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,199
Yes, that's how it works.

115
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,199
What do you call a guy with no arms?

116
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:51,199
And no legs and sits at your front door?

117
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,199
What?

118
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,199
Matt.

119
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,199
Do you get it, Peyton?

120
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,199
No.

121
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Cause he was drunk.

122
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,199
Right?

123
00:03:57,199 --> 00:03:58,199
Like a dormant.

124
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,199
Always a dormant.

125
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:00,199
Oh, sorry.

126
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,199
You're not mining, get that thing.

127
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,199
Oh.

128
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:03,199
It's really surprising that you're like jokes.

129
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,199
You have to really think.

130
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,199
What?

131
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,199
What?

132
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:07,199
What?

133
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,199
What?

134
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,199
What?

135
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:10,199
What?

136
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:11,199
Matt.

137
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,199
You're not.

138
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,199
You're not.

139
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:14,199
You're not.

140
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,199
You're not.

141
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,199
You're not.

142
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,199
You're not.

143
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,199
You're not.

144
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,199
You're not.

145
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,199
You're not.

146
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,199
You're not.

147
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,199
You're not.

148
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:23,199
Thanks a lot, Roy.

149
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,199
Come on, man.

150
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,199
I'll pack a brother.

151
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,199
These are riddles, TV.

152
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,199
He's delivering away now.

153
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
Hmm.

154
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,199
How do you get Pikachu on a bus?

155
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,199
You poke him on.

156
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,199
He's...

157
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,199
Fine.

158
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
I'm a smiling.

159
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,199
I'm a smiling.

160
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,199
Right?

161
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,199
What's your business?

162
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:45,199
You're verbally smiling.

163
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,199
That's a lot.

164
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,199
You're verbally smiling.

165
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,199
You're verbally smiling.

166
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,199
You're verbally smiling.

167
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,199
I'm a smiling.

168
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,199
I'm a smiling.

169
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,199
Wow.

170
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,199
Okay.

171
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,199
Where do girls have the most curly hair?

172
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,199
Where?

173
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,199
Africa.

174
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,199
Who would you find these?

175
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,199
Africa.

176
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,199
Oh, give me that one.

177
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,199
That's...

178
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,199
I don't need.

179
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:13,199
You're gonna find these.

180
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,199
Thank you.

181
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,199
I don't need.

182
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,199
Don't...

183
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:17,199
Hey, Timmy.

184
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,199
What's there?

185
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,199
No.

186
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,199
Wait.

187
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:21,199
It's all yours.

188
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,199
You have to find these.

189
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,199
Africa.

190
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,199
Oh, give me that one.

191
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,199
I don't need to.

192
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,199
Thank you.

193
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,199
It's all yours.

194
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,199
I'm glad we're all done.

195
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,599

An old man and young girl go across the road.

Who do you hit first?

230
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I don't know.

231
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Neither. You hit the brakes.

232
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
They are all fucking riddles actually.

233
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,199
I'm making me laugh.

234
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,199
These are dead facts.

235
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,199
Yeah.

236
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,199
Oh, shit.

237
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,199
Yeah.

238
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,199
Oh, shit.

239
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
I'll look service on the outside.

240
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,199
Teeth.

241
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,199
I'll look at the killer.

242
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,199
Yeah.

243
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,199
Thanks.

244
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,199
How do you say I'm constipated in German?

245
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,199
Tell me.

246
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,199
I'm far from pooping.

247
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,599
You're gonna laugh.

248
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,599
I think it's a laugh that is making me laugh.

249
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,599
Got him.

250
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:36,599
That's a cool one.

251
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:37,599
Thank you.

252
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,599
I know I thought of you, but I'm sorry.

253
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,599
I like that.

254
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:42,599
That's what's constipated.

255
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,599
How do you get Hessian herpes?

256
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,599
I don't know.

257
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,599
From rooting old bags.

258
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't know.

259
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
She was fun fact of the day.

260
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
I love her delivery.

261
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
Do you know what Hessian is?

262
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Yeah, it's a bag like a Hessian sandwich.

263
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Yes, I know.

264
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I just wanted to give it a shot.

265
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
It just wasn't that funny.

266
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,400
I understood it.

267
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
I understood it.

268
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Thank you.

269
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Oh, Timmy asked me if I understood something.

270
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
That's cool.

271
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Got some real battle on the mind.

272
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
Shit.

273
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
This is the final stage of the event.

274
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

275
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have a have seafood.

276
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,600
What do you call a bra in Dutch?

277
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,600
A stop and from flopping.

278
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Flopping.

279
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Flopping of.

280
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Flopping of.

281
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Flopping of.

282
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
All right, stop it from flopping.

283
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
You're just stopping in flopping.

284
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
Flopping.

285
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
You'reocrine.

286
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
You're gonna get it.

287
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
Get em out.

288
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,600
No, I do.

289
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I feel like that's only reserved for cat that one.

290
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I got my own cat.

291
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,600
How did that go up?

292
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Did you see me on your own face?

293
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
It did.

294
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I did it.

295
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,600
I did it right.

296
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
What the hell is that?

297
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,600
I don't know.

298
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm not going to be on my own face.

299
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
What the hell is that?

300
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
It's all a boy.

301
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
It's all a girl.

302
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
It's all a girl.

303
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
It's all a girl.

304
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,600
What do you get when you cross Timmy and a disco ball?

305
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
A shimmy.

306
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
Oh my god.

307
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
That was it.

308
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,600
Thanks for that one.

309
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
I thought you like it.

310
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Shimmy.

311
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,600
That's what I'm going to be like.

312
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
You good?

313
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,600
Yeah.

314
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
Not really.

315
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Yep.

316
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,600
How can you tell if a cabbage is boiled?

317
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
You boil it.

318
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,600
The wheelchair floats at the top.

319
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,600
You are just like...

320
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,600
Every disabled joke you can think of.

321
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,600
Don't let a chromosome get you down.

322
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Oh my god.

323
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:27,600
That was so quick.

324
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,600
That's on to me.

325
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,600
Quickness.

326
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
Quickness.

327
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,600
It doesn't look like any quick.

328
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Me talk faster time.

329
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,600
Timmy's allowed to say these as well.

330
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,600
What do German pedophiles and chocolate holics have in common?

331
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,600
They both love Kinder.

332
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,600
Yes.

333
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Thanks for the yes, Matt.

334
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Love that.

335
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
It matches.

336
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,600
Yes.

337
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,600
More German.

338
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
That's just zergort.

339
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
Overjogging.

340
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Please go down.

341
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
What's the difference between yourself and a bus?

342
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
What?

343
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,600
When riding a bus, everyone gets off.

344
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:33,600
I have no respect.

345
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,600
You got it.

346
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Just in case.

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,600
Wow.

348
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Timmy, I feel like that just really crossed the line.

349
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Why did Stephen Hawking not make it to heaven?

350
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
It wasn't an elevator.

351
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Only stairs.

352
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Nice.

353
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,600
Nice.

354
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,600
I can't go getting to heaven.

355
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
What do you call a nuns wheelchair?

356
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,600
What?

357
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,600
A virgin mobile.

358
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
Timmy, what the fuck?

359
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,600
Timmy, what the fuck?

360
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
Timmy, what the fuck?

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
Because I was like, was it mobile or maybe ill?

362
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Bummy Spell and was not good day.

363
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
It's a hot one again.

364
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
It's hot and sour.

365
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,600
It's hot and sour.

366
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Ready?

367
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
No, really ready.

368
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
What is...

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
What did you say?

370
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,600
I thought it was my go.

371
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
I'll listen to you.

372
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
It's gone.

373
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Give me a good one.

374
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Make me laugh.

375
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
The artichewer on you today.

376
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
I don't know.

377
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,600
What if I tried to say something?

378
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,600
I don't know.

379
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
I don't know.

380
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
I tried to say it.

381
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,600
Oh, right.

382
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,600
You're getting sassy.

383

Why?

408
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Because no one will ever be greater than Hitler.

Oh my god, Jimmy.

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Oh, I wish I could come back.

415
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
That's all I have to say.

416
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,600

They're gone.

425
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
And tequila really hurts.

426
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
You want it?

427
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Tequila really hurts.

428
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Which is tequila?

429
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
So because I had to do a pill please.

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Oh!

431
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Oh, I can't come on, please.

You got to go on.

433
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
You got to go on.

434
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
What do you call a disabled kid with a gun?

435
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,600
Special forces.

436
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
Jimmy.

437
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Special forces.

438
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
What a good accent.

439
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,600
What a good accent.

440
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
What a good accent.

441
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm not going to talk to you.

442
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
I just...you?

443
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,600
Oh my god. Can you do the punchline again?

444
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
I want to see the front of your face do it.

445
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
I want the gun.

446
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Major Buffy.

447
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Okay, well I laughed at the start.

448
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Good work, little pig.

449
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Okay, what board is on stupidity?

450
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Mexico and Canada.

451
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Hey, hey.

452
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,600
I'm another one.

453
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Can I say another one?

454
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,600
What's a narcissist favorite thing to say?

455
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Hey, I'm Rory Lowe and I'm a comedian.

456
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Oh my god.

457
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
It's an early roast.

458
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,600
It's an early roast.

459
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,600
You just need all my mind, Rory Lowe.

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Sway.

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Tired of money.

462
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,600
It's a real need to show off to her.

463
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
How I'd do this roast now.

464
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
I learned something new the other day.

465
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Oh yeah?

466
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,600
That the parapussy will throw you further than Dona-Mont.

467
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,600
Motivational speaking.

468
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
That was a fun tune.

469
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,599
That's one.

470
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,599
That was a fun tune.

471
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,599
It was a fun tune.

472
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,599
That was a fun tune.

473
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,599
It was a fun tune.

474
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
Mar-a, the pussy can pose here.

475
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,599
You are not being disabled to an everybody but oh my god.

476

Bells and tv.
