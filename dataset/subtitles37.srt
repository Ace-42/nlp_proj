1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
What's a gal's favorite number?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You tell me.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
16.

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Because she gets 8 twice.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hey!

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I got her.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Friend.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I've won!

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Alright, south before they start.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I've got Matt.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I bet you a bottle of Patron.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Matt wins.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're an idiot.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm Go Cat.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah!

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That's good.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alright.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Have you watched yet, Matt?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Don't f*** this up, Matt.

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
There's a bottle on the line.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So you haven't watched my past performances?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Poor remembered them.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Because I don't know.

25
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Um, scissors paper rock.

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Alright, yes.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's that time again.

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay, scissors paper rock.

29
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That was the quickest one.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What do you want to give us?

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'll go first.

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What is Mickey Mouse's favorite sport?

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What?

34
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Mini golf.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Cute.

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Yes.

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That was a warm up.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
OK?

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll do warm up when it's about fun.

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Alright.

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Alright, what's the difference between me and your eight-n-a-dew?

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Who?

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What?

45
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I came home from camp.

46
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What?

47
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
F***!

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
This dude, what the f***?

49
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, heavy head.

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Catherine!

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I've got faith in you, Matt.

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've got faith.

53
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, Kat.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey.

55
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you hear about the German domestic violence victim?

56
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I did not.

57
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He Hitler.

58
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
A bit of a strong laugh, though.

59
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's fine.

60
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Alright, let's lean into the Hitler jokes.

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Um.

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mmm.

63
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
That's favorite.

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Where did Sally go during the bombing?

65
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
F***!

66
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sally's dead, bro.

67
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
F***!

68
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, it's done a rough job.

69
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, sh**, it's done a rough job.

70
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It was just a...

71
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Come, come, come, come.

72
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, OK, OK.

73
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do the joke, do the joke.

74
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Alright.

75
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to the next one.

76
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How do you do that?

77
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh, sorry.

78
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to get in the office.

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Oh, sorry.

80
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,840
Come, come, come.

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,680
Oh, okay.

82
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,520
Do the joke, do the joke.

83
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
All right.

84
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,680
Where did Celeco join the boving?

85
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,000
Everywhere.

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh.

87
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh.

88
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
Oh.

89
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,120
That only can't says one.

90
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,120
It does.

91
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,120
It does.

92
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,879
I called it, I called it early.

93
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,960
But not the punchline.

94
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
Just that shit.

95
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,800
No, just the dead part.

96
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Dead part.

97
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Dead, dead, dead, dead.

98
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,599
Yeah, yes, that's right.

99
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:59,400
Yeah.

100
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,599
Poois, Celeco.

101
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,920
What do the LGBT people and scoliosis have in common?

102
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,919
None of them are straight.

103
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,919
Yeah.

104
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,919
I like that one.

105
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,919
Correct.

106
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,919
Why does an Ethiopian baby cry?

107
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,919
We wouldn't be crying.

108
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,919
What?

109
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,919
It's having a midlife crisis.

110
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:24,919
So?

111
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:28,919
What is it, so many?

112
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,919
Oh my god.

113
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,919
It's so many.

114
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:32,919
Oh my god.

115
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:33,919
It's so many!

116
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,919
I don't know if that was a laugh.

117
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:36,919
It doesn't.

118
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:38,919
When you cross those a laugh, that was a laugh.

119
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:39,919
No.

120
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,919
That was a laugh.

121
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,919
That was a laugh.

122
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:42,919
Laugh.

123
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:46,919
What is a shark and a computer happen common?

124
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:47,919
I don't know.

125
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:48,919

Cat.

148
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
So.

149
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Julian Assange had two children with his loyal while in exile.

150
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,920
I realized this gave new meaning to the words pro bono.

151
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
Yeah.

152
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,920
Yeah.

153
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,920
I like that.

154
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,920
Thank you.

155
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,920
Because it was a bono.

156
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
It was a bono.

157
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I love bono stuff.

158
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,920
Um, why didn't Anne Frank finish her diary?

159
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Dead.

160
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Concentration problems.

161
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Oh, that's...

162
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
Oh, my God.

163
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,920
That's so good.

164
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
That was a...

165
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
...

166
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
...

170
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
She did it.

171
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
She did it.

172
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
She did it.

173
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Well, I can smell this fireball and it's so yucky.

174
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,920
I am...

198
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
...

199
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
...

200
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
...

201
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,920
...

202
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
...

203
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
...

204
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
...

205
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
...

206
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,920
...

207
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,920
...

208
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
...

209
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,920
That was a good one.

210
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
Oh, what was a good one?

211
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Except for my fingering.

212
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
I'm...

213
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
...

214
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
...

215
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,920
...

216
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
...

217
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
...

218
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
...

219
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Oh!

220
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,920
Click!

221
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
Oh no!

222
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
That's messed up.

223
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
That doesn't ask me.

224
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
That doesn't ask me.

225
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
You'll go?

226
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Yep.

227
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Cool.

228
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,920
So I got kicked out of the hospital one time.

229
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,920
Apparently, the sign for Stroke patients here

230
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
meant something totally different.

231
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,920
Hi, that was a good one.

232
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,920
To get that one, she's jerking them off.

233
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Yeah, I get it.

234
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,920
Never done it, but I get it.

235
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,420
The...

236
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,620
Hahahaha!

237
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,819
Anel sex is a lot like Brussels sprouts.

238
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,620
If you had it as a child, you weren't like it as an adult.

239
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,620
Hahahaha!

240
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,120
Oh my god!

241
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,120
Hahahaha!

242
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Hahahaha!

243
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,420
I don't know, I'm getting older.

244
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,120
I think Anel's pretty good.

245
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,220
Your job?

246
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,720
Yeah, I like Brussels sprouts.

247
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Hahahaha!

248
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,920
Hahahaha!

249
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
Hahahaha!

250
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,420
Okay, okay, okay.

251
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,420
Um, what do you do when you finish a magazine at school?

252
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,420
Yeah.

253
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,920
You reload.

254
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Oh!

255
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Hahahaha!

256
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Yes!

257
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Hahahaha!

258
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,920
I think that one might get caught!

259
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Hahahaha!

260
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,120
It's alright, we'll try it.

261
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,120
Hopefully...

262
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
I'm fast off there.

263
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
Hahahaha!

264
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
I don't know what I'm doing.

265
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
I wouldn't say that you had a school zoned!

266
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
Hey, I think you might have to get a school zoned!

267
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
That was a huge shit.

268
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
How much lube does it take to have Anel sex?

269
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
A butt load.

270
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Hahahaha!

271
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,120
That's a good one.

272
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Yeah, that one.

273
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
So that is...

274
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Yeah.

275
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,120
What do you call Anel sex on an airplane?

276
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
High as fuck!

277
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Hahahaha!

278
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Hahahaha!

279
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Hahahaha!

280
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Hahahaha!

281
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Hahahaha!

282
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Hahahaha!

283
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,120
Hahahaha!

284
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,120
Hahahaha!

285
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Hahahaha!

286
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Hahahaha!

287
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I'm sorry!

288
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,120
You okay?

289
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,120
I'm sorry!

290
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
I'm really sorry a bit.

291
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
They were all just Anel jokes from...

292
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,120
I'm sorry!

293
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
They were all just Anel jokes!

294
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Do not apologize.

295
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,120
It's alright Matt, I was hoping that you would come from behind.

296
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
I'm here!

297
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm here!

298
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,120
I'm here!

299
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm here!

300
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,120
It is...

301
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
It is...

302
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,120
It's a hard child.

303
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,120
It's a hard child.

304
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
It is...

305
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
It is...

306
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,120
It's a hard child.

307
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
Oh yeah, did it.

308
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,120
Um, why is it so hard to argue as a woman who's not wearing a bra?

309
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,120
Why?

310
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
She's already made two great points.

311
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Hmm.

312
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,120
Hmm.

313
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,120
Hmm.

314
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Oh, what's that?

315
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,120
That was the one I didn't know I did that.

316
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
I don't know!

317
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Bro!

318
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
Bro!

319
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Bro!

320
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
It's not funny!

321
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
You did slow!

322
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,120
You did slow!

323
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
I said his most...

324
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
His most deepest darkest thoughts.

325
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,120
Just some...

326
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,120
As soon as you don't know that, go see Protector Pay.

327
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
You're the only one I've ever seen.

328
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
I keep down all I did to those crazy...

329
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I don't know why I did that.

330
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Oh, actually I got some other ones I don't...

331
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,120
I can't mix it up.

332
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Did you hear about the constipated cast?

333
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
There you go.

334
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,120
He just couldn't budge it!

335
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Where was it?

336
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,120
He just couldn't budge it!

337
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,120
What was that?

338
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Bro, he's having such a great life now.

339
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
Sad against that again.

340
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,120
How did you hear about the constipated accountant?

341
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I don't know why that's funny.

342
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
He just couldn't budge it.

343
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Let's use the steaming organic.

344
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,120
He just couldn't budge it.

345
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Clush, Clush.

346
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
There I go.

347
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,120
Oh, fuck you, man!

348
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,120
So there's only B word that you should call women as beautiful?

349
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,120
This bitch is love when you call them beautiful.

350
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Go ahead and sing.

351
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
She's a bit bitch.

352
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
That's a bit of a basketball.

353
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
That's good.

354
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
I went bird watching with this chick.

355
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,120
And there's just something about the way she was counting the birds.

356
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,120
She was like,

357
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Hawk 1.

358
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,120
Hawk 2!

359
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Yes!

360
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Yes!

361
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes!

362
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
I wrote that.

363
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Yes!

364
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Prove it.

365
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,120
The spellings wrong in this joke.

366
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,120
No one knew.

367
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
No one knew how to spell it.

368
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
The best one is he wrote another one.

369
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,120
And it was Hawk 3.

370
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,120
I got you one ready.

371
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Oh, thank you.

372
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Oh, because a lot.

373
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,120
It's supposed to not laugh, man.

374
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,120
What's the difference between a female farmer and Hitler's girlfriend?

375
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,120
One bails her hay and the other hails her bag.

376
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Thank you.

377
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:50,120
What do you call a large group of men who recently found out they've been cheated on?

378
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I don't know.

379
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
A fluster cuck.

380
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Yeah.

381
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Yeah.

382
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Yeah, I love them.

383
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Yeah.

384
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
Like a clusterfuck?

385
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
No, I get it.

386
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
Yeah, it's like...

387
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
He's crying.

388
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
I'm fine.

389
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I'm really trying.

390
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Hold it in, baby.

391
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Or we'll just get better than we try to explain the matter.

392
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
No.

393
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Okay, what?

394
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
How do you embarrass not?

395
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,120
How do you embarrass not?

396
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,120
How do you embarrass not?

397
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,120
You're what we're how?

398
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
How do you embarrass not?

399
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
We are.

400
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
We're what we're where.

401
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
You.

402
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Who is going on?

403
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
This is the worst fag I've ever met.

404
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
Hey, Kate.

405
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Kate.

406
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Kate.

407
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Kate.

408
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Kate.

409
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Kate.

410
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Wait, do you think it's fair to say that?

411
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Kate.

412
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
There's no way, but it is.

413
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
There's no way.

414
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,120
He doesn't know who he's versus.

415
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,120
Hey, Patrick.

416
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Poor him.

417
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Poor him.

418
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Poor him.

419
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
A version of poor him.

420
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Poor him, right?

421
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Poor him, right?

422
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,120
This one's for my gaming friends out there in the world.

423
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
Hopefully this lands.

424
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,120
My gamers.

425
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,120
Why can't you have sex after playing Assassin's Creed?

426
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,120
Oh, why?

427
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Because you be soft.

428
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
Oh, I don't get it.

429
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:26,120
No one's going to fuck you because you're playing Assassin's Creed.

430
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,120
No.

431
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
No.

432
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
No.

433
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,120
No.

434
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
No.

435
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,120
No.

436
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
No.

437
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
No.

438
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
No.

439
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
No.

440
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,120
No.

441
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
No.

442
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
No.

443
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
No.

444
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,120
No.

445
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,120
No.

446
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,120
No.

447
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
No.

448
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,120
No.

449
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,120
No.

450
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,120
No.

451
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
No.

452
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
No.

453
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
No.

454
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,120
No.

455
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,120
No.

456
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,120
No.

457
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,120
No.

458
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
You're so important today.

459
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Do you know why you shouldn't go for a cheap circumcision?

460
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,120
What?

461
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
You see, nothing but a rip-off.

462
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Mm-hmm.

463
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
Oh.

464
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Oh.

465
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
Oh.

466
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
What is an alternative?

467
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,120
What is an alternative term for anal bleaching?

468
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,120
A changing your ring term?

469
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:25,120
What's the score?

470
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,120
Two in the score!

471
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,120
Fuck!

472
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,120
See, I got one, but it's not enough!

473
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Alright.

474
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Now it's next five.

475
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
What do you get if you stuffed your hand up a gypsy's

476
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,120
where she is on her period?

477
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
What?

478
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,120
Your palm is red.

479
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Oh my god!

480
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Oh my god!

481
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,120
Why is he f**king excited to join us?

482
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:12,120
That'll be my favourite joke, tell her what else is.

483
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,120
That wins!

484
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Wow!

485
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,120
Yeah!

486
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Yeah, Kat!

487
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,120
That was such a good joke!

488
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Yeah, that last joke is definitely worth more than one point.

489
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
That deserves a win at the end.

490
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Is that an Indian exit?

491
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
It's what he was missing!

492
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Yeah, I got Kat!

493
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,120
He could say I'm a IOU bottle.
