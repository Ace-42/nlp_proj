1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The man is...

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
She is a...

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
She is a...

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Yeah!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yay!

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Oh!

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yay!

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm dead.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Amy?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Okay! You got me!

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Alright!

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't twist my arm!

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
She's a queen!

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
She's Louise!

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I feel something twisted.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Alright, so, Dad jokes?

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Hit me with that.

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sizzes, paper, rock.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, okay.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Sorry, I'm not chanted.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Which fist ways?

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, rock.

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sizzes, paper, rock.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, here you are!

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'll come first.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
That's hurt you always too.

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I always do.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I always do.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I um...

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I gave my chicken by Agro.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright, now my chicken lays hard boiled eggs.

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hard boiled eggs.

33
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't encourage them.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay.

35
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, I'll see your chicken joke.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Yay!

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Louise!

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Alright!

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Something's raised, I don't know.

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I made a chicken salad the other day.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yum.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It turns out chicken's hate salad.

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't know if that was a joke or if she was trying to fuck you.

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, that's not what I'd be.

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, um...

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I feel like I'm already red and I have to touch drinks.

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Okay.

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's the happy.

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Slap.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Still at all.

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Cheers.

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't want you to drink alone.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That's Louise's every evening.

54
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I ain't no loser.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah.

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Knock knock.

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who's there?

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Pretty mature ejaculated.

59
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I think Jack.

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I think Jack.

61
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Louise.

62
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Check his pants.

63
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm wearing black, it's okay.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, no.

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
That's a drink.

66
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Was that the entire joke?

67
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The churro ejaculator who?

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
No, no.

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I already finished that joke.

71
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Everybody drink.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, a little bit.

73
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We need because you...

74
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, that's a sweet one.

75
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay, he's trying to black out right now.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I brought my other chocolate blasts too.

77
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So did I.

78
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This is fun.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is it bad that I start drinking as soon as the kids get to school?

80
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Or does that make me a bad teacher?

81
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yeah.

82
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

83
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah.

84
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh.

85
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Everybody drink.

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We've nailed it.

87
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay, I would...

88
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I would've loved for you to be my teacher.

89
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yeah.

90
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cheers.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So, I had sex with one of your food delivery robots.

93
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It dropped off...

94
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It dropped off its load and so did I.

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I refuse.

96
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I refuse.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I refuse.

98
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I refuse.

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I refuse.

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I refuse.

101
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You refuse too.

102
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I refuse to laugh at that.

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, fuck it!

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, my god.

105
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, my god.

106
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's not bad.

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Woohoo!

108
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Big money.

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So, way more anyone knows that I was expecting a hoose.

110
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, no.

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He's fucking the real one.

112
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, I guess...

113
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He's a sport.

114
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
He's a sport.

115
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
He's a little man.

116
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's a little man.

117
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He's a little kidy.

118
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
That's why there's a robot in our Airbnb as well.

119
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He had that in a robot.

120
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What's going on?

121
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can't believe it.

122
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The robot's like, please...

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
dismantle me, start.

124
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That's dirty talk.

125
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's that?

126
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, my god.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You know, it's really hard to be an adult star when your electos intolerant.

128
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The cream pie is really messing with my stomach.

129
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, shit, my pants.

130
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll shoot my pants too, because I'm lactose.

131
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Okay, mutual pants.

132
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Okay.

133
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can we try another one?

134
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You want to try another one?

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

136
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not going to do it.

137
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm not going to do it.

138
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can we try another one?

139
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You want to try another one?

140
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you call?

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That was good.

142
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Did you love?

143
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll take it.

144
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Take it up here.

145
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Take it up here.

146
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Take it up here.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah!

148
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Woo!

149
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not going to stop.

150
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not going to stop.

151
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm not going to stop.

152
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just laughed again.

153
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We're going to do that.

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's too easy.

155
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm going to stop.

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I met this Chinese porn star.

157
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Shit.

158
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, the SharePoint.

159
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
She...

160
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I met this Chinese porn star.

161
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
She gave me a wool hand job.

162
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, my God.

163
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, my God.

164
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, my God.

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's over for us.

166
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's over for us.

167
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Woo!

168
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, my God.

169
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, my God.

170
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Shit.

171
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Everybody.

172
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Everybody.

173
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

174
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let the photo.

175
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We're here now.

176
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
We're in it.

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
We're in it.

178
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
We're in it.

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Yeah, but...

180
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's find out.

181
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Why are you looking for that?

182
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Let me tell you about the Chairman Pro package.

183
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The ultimate grooming experience,

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
which features the Chairman Pro electric foil shaver.

185
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Featuring a 360 degree,

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
contouring head, which comes with two interchangeable,

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
skin-safe blade heads.

188
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You good?

189
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Still need time?

190
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You've got that skin-safe,

191
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
full-blade foil for that super-close shave.

192
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
And the skin-safe double trimmer.

193
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If you want to keep that landing strip trimmed,

Okay, let me try another one.

216
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Here you are.

217
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

218
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I laughed, I laughed.

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
He wants it.

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He wants it.

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
He wants it.

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000

00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm the freebie.

225
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
This is the game now.

226
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm the freebie.

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000

228
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you know what my favourite pawn categories?

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Tell me.

230
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's a Covid just turned 19.

231
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh my god.

232
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You said Covid.

233
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You said Covid just turned 19.

234
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Covid.

235
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You said Covid.

236
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No, Covid.

237
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's my second favourite.

238
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We're in.

239
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
We're in.

240
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey.

241
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where did it put me?

242
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I feel like I need to just cross my legs.

243
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah, just relax your ass.

244
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hold on.

245
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't, I can go back to the hotel.

246
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Just relax.

247
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Just relax.

248
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
For some people,

249
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
nine months doesn't seem like a long time, right?

250
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But for some, it seems like a maternity.

251
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
That's great.

252
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's great.

253
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can come and give it to someone.

254
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can have it a little.

255
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Yeah.

256
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I feel like right now,

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
when I take a shot, she takes a shot.

258
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That's fun.

259
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh my god.

260
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a good thing.

261
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a good thing.

262
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's a good thing.

263
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So I come from the land down under,

264
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
whereas in your use to people coming on your land down under.

265
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I feel like in.

266
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I feel like in.

267
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I feel like in.

268
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello, you're not used to that.

269
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I come from the land down under.

270
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh my god.

271
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh my god.

272
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh my god.

273
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh my god.

274
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh my god.

275
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sing it.

276
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Sing it with your chest.

277
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Like Joey Chestnut.

278
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Oh my god.

279
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sing it loud.

280
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Sing it loud.

281
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
How does it go?

282
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I come from the land down under.

283
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I come from the land down under.

284
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I feel like I do those layers better than those trillion people.

285
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's a good thing.

286
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a good thing.

287
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright.

288
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So, we're going to kind of express the other day,

289
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
but it wasn't food.

290
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It was just even falling down the Hollywood hell.

291
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh my god.

292
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Holy shit.

293
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That is crazy.

294
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh my god.

295
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh my god.

296
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Holy shit.

297
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That is crazy.

298
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Dana, you're an adult film star.

299
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Sure.

300
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So you're quite thin.

301
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
But I couldn't do your diet because it's just nuts.

302
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh my god.

303
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And some fake.

304
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Come on.

305
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Get me some credit.

306
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Have you got tips?

307
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Yeah.

308
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You got me.

309
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm skinny.

310
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
We need more cream pot.

311
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I got this later.

312
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Who cares?

313
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, she's so good.

314
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Did you hear about the guy with a fruit fetish?

315
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He's bucking bananas.

316
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They love that.

317
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
A fruit fetish.

318
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
That's good.

319
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
He loved it.

320
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He loved it.

321
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel like we're both agreed that we're just going to like...

322
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Drink every time.

323
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I love this.

324
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I love this.

325
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
So I refuse to believe I'm gay.

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You know, don't let it go.

327
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Yeah.

328
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I refuse to believe I'm gay.

329
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm in denial.

330
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I think he pronounces it Daniel.

331
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
And he was in me.

332
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You're in denial.

333
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You're in denial.

334
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You're in denial.

335
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
You're in denial.

336
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You're in denial.

337
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You're in denial.

338
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Yeah.

339
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I just found out I had a stepson.

340
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
How do we get rid of this all the career?

341
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh my god.

342
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay, well I guess.

343
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's part of what we're doing now.

344
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is that...

345
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is that...

346
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Could someone call me a new bird?

347
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Call us a new bird?

348
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Oh god.

349
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Could someone to call me?

350
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Get him out of here!

351
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
He instant into a pimfton.

352
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
He's absolutely roasting me up here.

353
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I guess someone helped him.

354
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yeah man, he's...

355
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
She's a friend of mine.

356
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah!

357
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Yeah!

358
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Yeah!

359
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yeah!

360
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah!

361
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah!

362
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yeah!

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Yeah!

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah!

365
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
That's what we show.

366
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yeah!

367
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah!

368
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You're on the team.

369
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What did this idol film star have for lunch?

370
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Me?

371
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Five guys.

372
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
There's two different girls!

373
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh!

374
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Yeah!

375
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh my god.

376
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I guess.

377
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It won.

378
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Yeah!

379
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yeah!

380
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I'm gonna give it a try.

381
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm gonna give it a try.

382
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm gonna win.

383
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm gonna win.
