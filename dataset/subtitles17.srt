1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What country's capital is going to fastest in the world?

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,120
How do you not know this?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,120
You really don't know what?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,120
Ireland. It's Dublin.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,120
You're a comedic genius.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,920
I don't know about...

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,420
Somebody's about to make the set.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Welcome to Celebrity Dad Jokes.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,080
I am Nick Cannon.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:33,479
I'm super dad. Today we're going to be telling some dad jokes with the one and only Kevin Hart.

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,479
Hurry up, Nick.

12
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:36,479
Another super dad.

13
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,799
And we're going to be talking about his new show. Another show.

14
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:40,799
This show is very special. Little cat.

15
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,799
There she is, man.

16
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:43,799
I'm really excited about it.

17
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:46,039
We're going to get to it.

18
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:48,039
And you know how this works, man.

19
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,039
The rules are you laugh you lose.

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,039
We're going to be doing some dad jokes.

21
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:53,239
So the goal is not to laugh.

22
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:54,039
Not to laugh.

23
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:55,239
But if it gets you.

24
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:56,039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:58,039
We being...

26
00:00:58,039 --> 00:00:59,039
King of Corny.

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,039
I got it.

28
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,039
This is what I do.

29
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,039
I got it. I got it.

30
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:03,039
I'm a famous dad joke.

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,039
So I'm just...

32
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:06,039
You ready?

33
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,039
I'm ready.

34
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,039
You go for it.

35
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:15,039
What do you call a musician who's bad with money?

36
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:17,039
Sorry, funny.

37
00:01:19,039 --> 00:01:21,039
What do you call it?

38
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,039
Broke Eropocity.

39
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Go.

40
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
You next.

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,040
All right.

42
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,040
All right. Did you know it was illegal to laugh loudly in Hawaii?

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,040
You didn't know that?

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
No.

45
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,040
Yeah, you got to keep a low-haw.

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
Stupid.

47
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Low-haw.

48
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Low-haw.

49
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
That's good.

50
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
All right, good.

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
All right.

52
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Oh, boy.

53
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
All right.

54
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,040
Did you hear about what happened to the vampires in New York?

55
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
No.

56
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Got killed with the cheese steak.

57
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,040
Okay, come on.

58
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,040
To the heart.

59
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
All right.

60
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
That's stupid.

61
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
Now, that's dumb.

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Now, that's dumb.

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
That was dumb.

64
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,040
That was dumb.

65
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,040
It's on the car.

66
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
No, that's dumb.

67
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
That was...

68
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
That's cheese steak.

69
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
Did you do it from Philly?

70
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
We talked about that.

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Yeah, that's why that was stupid.

72
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
That was stupid.

73
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
That was stupid.

74
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,040
That was stupid.

75
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,040
That was stupid.

76
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
That was stupid.

77
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,040
That was stupid.

78
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,040
That was stupid.

79
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
That joke.

80
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Okay.

81
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,039
That pizza man stuck in the press.

82
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,039
No.

83
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:33,039
Well, probably didn't hear it because there wasn't mushroom.

84
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,039
Let's talk a little bit.

85
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,039
Congratulations.

86
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,039
Thank you, man.

87
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,039
It's animated.

88
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:48,039
I mean, you are always on the cutting edge in doing things that people don't get to do.

89
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,039
I mean, tell the world about...

90
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:54,039
Let's give them an overview of what audiences can expect.

91
00:02:54,039 --> 00:03:00,039
Look, this is one of the things that I gotta be honest is a passion project.

92
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:03,039
I've been trying to develop this for over seven or eight years,

93
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,039
and try to figure out a way to get into the animation space

94
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,039
from a perspective in my point of view,

95
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,039
but to where I could also highlight my city in a way that nobody else could.

96
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,039
I feel like, you know, when you talk about the hood

97
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,039
and we talk about our environment that we grew up in,

98
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:26,039
it's always painted with a crazy bad overview.

99
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,039
Right.

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:28,039
People always highlight the bad,

101
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:31,039
and I was like, there's so much good in the bad.

102
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,039
You know, like when you talk about the neighborhood,

103
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,039
with the people that aren't necessarily at the top of the food chain in life,

104
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,039
but they serve a valuable purpose to the community.

105
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,039
This animation is about uplifting those people.

106
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,039
You know, the guy that's on the corner, the people that are on the stoop.

107
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:53,039
The neighborhood knows the woman that's in the window watching the kids,

108
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,039
and that responsibility to tell on the kids to their parents,

109
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,039
and how many people actually are raising a kid,

110
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,039
like in a community like that. It takes a village.

111
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,039
So just kind of showing what that village dynamic was for me as I was coming up.

112
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:10,039
That's dope, and when I look at it, even the animation style is nostalgic.

113
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,039
Like it feels like the cartoon we grew up watching,

114
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:15,039
like without purposeful, like...

115
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:16,039
All all intent.

116
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,039
All all done with the strong intent to be different,

117
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:23,039
go back to the times where I was a kid,

118
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:27,039
things that I gravitated towards, the reason why cartoons were special.

119
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:29,039
You know, I wanted to feel that,

120
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,039
and I wanted the kids today to feel it.

121
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,039
You know, and my test was my kids, you know, giving my kids.

122
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,039
They rock with it?

123
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:36,039
Yeah, that was it. That's the big test.

124
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:37,039
You passed the test and you're like...

125
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:38,039
So it was like that.

126
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
This is it.

127
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
So have do...

128
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,040
No, they had this funny.

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Like when it goes...

130
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,040
Because they are a top audience.

131
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
I know your kids.

132
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Your kids will be like...

133
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
We're no longer cool, which is why this is what I get.

134
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Oh, this is why it gets working.

135
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,040
This is very much fitting right now.

136
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm fine with that.

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Yeah, I'm fine with that.

138
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
Let's get right back to it.

139
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,040
What do you call a moose with no name?

140
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,040
I don't know.

141
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
A Nana moose.

142
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Okay.

143
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
Alright.

144
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Because he's a...

145
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
I get it.

146
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
You don't know his name.

147
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
I get it.

148
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
But he's a moose.

149
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I get it.

150
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Instead of saying a Nana moose.

151
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah.

152
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Instead of saying a Nana moose.

153
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
You just put moose.

154
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
Yeah.

155
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
I get that.

156
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I urge you.

157
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I got it.

158
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
Yeah.

159
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
No.

160
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Okay.

161
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
What do you call beef cropped against the wall?

162
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
Whoa, this is a family show.

163
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,040
What do you call...

164
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,040
I want you to know you like that.

165
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
A lean meat.

166
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,040
That's a lean meat.

167
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Right.

168
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Propped against the wall.

169
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
You got to beef.

170
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,040
Propped against the wall.

171
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
So that's a lean meat.

172
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
That's what that is.

173
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Because lean it against the wall.

174
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
Against the wall.

175
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Okay.

176
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
I thought that was good.

177
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Yeah.

178
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
I'm getting a little bit more riskate.

179
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Yeah.

180
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Bro, that joke.

181
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,040
I was definitely dead jokes after dark.

182
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Alright.

183
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Alright.

184
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Oh.

185
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,040
What does Sylvester Stallone and Lil Kev's upbringing both have in common?

186
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,040
It actually is real question.

187
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,040
They both were a little rocky.

188
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
That's why you were a community.

189
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
Did I get it?

190
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Did I get it?

191
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
You dead?

192
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,040
Yeah.

193
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Right there on the call.

194
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Yeah.

195
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,040
I just really wanted to take for it.

196
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,040
I was like, you tell people I could have been a good student.

197
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
I just took a while for me to figure it out.

198
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,040
I get it.

199
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
Yeah.

200
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
I struggled with the work they was giving me.

201
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,040
We all did.

202
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,040
They was giving me stuff like this.

203
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
Eight plus.

204
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Eight plus.

205
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
Yeah.

206
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,040
The teachers were stupid.

207
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Alright.

208
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:39,040
Why did the patient refuse to pay the proctologist for her butt lift?

209
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
First of all, what's the proctologist?

210
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
Well, that's problematic.

211
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,040
You need to know what that is.

212
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,040
That's good to get.

213
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,040
Okay.

214
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
The big word through me.

215
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Why did the patient refuse to pay the proctologist for her butt lift?

216
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I don't know why.

217
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Come on, man.

218
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,040
She said it still had a little crack in it.

219
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,040
You got it.

220
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
They laughed.

221
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,040
I'm not paying for this.

222
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
It's still a crack in it.

223
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Why do I have a crack in it?

224
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
You got it.

225
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Explain it.

226
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,040
It's what he said.

227
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah, because it's imperfect.

228
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
It's a crack in it.

229
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
It's damaged.

230
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
I'm not paying for that.

231
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,040
Okay.

232
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Alright, man.

233
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Let's talk about the character.

234
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
How close is he to me?

235
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
The little Kevin Hart.

236
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,040
Oh, man.

237
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Very.

238
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
Very.

239
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Very.

240
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Very.

241
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Very.

242
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,040
Very.

243
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Very.

244
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Very, very.

245
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Very, very.

246
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Very, very, very.

247
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
The experience is when you open the story.

248
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,840
The story's in the real, real, real upbringing, real mom and dad moments.

249
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,040
You know, my mom and dad were never together.

250
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,939
So that separation and that stitching that relationship that they had through my upbringing

251
00:07:40,939 --> 00:07:41,939
was special.

252
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:42,939
Funny.

253
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:46,720
Now I can look back on it and grab all the humor from it.

254
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,720
But that dynamic of love, hate and problem was one that I was like really in the middle

255
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
of.

256
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,760
You know, having the older brother, having my uncle, you know, and having my mom be the

257
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,720
spiritual but strict and forced it as she was.

258
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Right.

259
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
You know what I mean?

260
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,040
Like where I fit it in the school, where the bullying came in, how I got around it, all

261
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,600
of those things are really coming from the mind of remember.

262
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,000
So I think the audience is going to respond to it because it's relatable.

263
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,680
It's relatable and I think, you know, anybody coming from the culture and from the

264
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,879
environment of the hood, you're going to be able to go, oh, I had moments that were

265
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,680
the same if not equally alive.

266
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,159
Now are there any specific memories that influenced the show?

267
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,159
Absolutely.

268
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,159
You know, I put the teacher bit in there.

269
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:40,159
Oh, the cousin.

270
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Yeah, when I went to custody, I was a teacher.

271
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,519
Clath, but they have the whole scene in there.

272
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,759
Whole scene of me going in and why and how I got the cousin out the teacher, my mom didn't

273
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,159
have to come to the school and mess up what she said.

274
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,840
She said and her saying it, but being honest and then her cousin to teach her out because

275
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,559
the teacher said some stuff that she didn't like.

276
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,559
You know, my first fight with the bully and how I had success in throwing the first punch.

277
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,559
Right.

278
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:10,559
I thought because of that, the fight was over and then the bully went on to whip my

279
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,960
ass out and you found out that the bully could fight and then vice I got from my uncle

280
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,799
was wrong, which was just hit him first.

281
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,159
Don't know bully expect you to hit him.

282
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,759
Swing on him first and watch everything change.

283
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,479
You literally are one of the greatest storytellers of our time and for you to take the stuff

284
00:09:29,479 --> 00:09:33,839
that we have known for and your stand up and hearing all these amazing stories and now

285
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:34,839
to see it animated man.

286
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,159
I mean, that's the next level.

287
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:37,159
Thank you, man.

288
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,039
All right.

289
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:47,240
What do you call it if low-cav gets beat up by a group of elderly people?

290
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,240
What do I call it?

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
Low-cav gets beat up by a group of elderly people.

292
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,039
I mean, a bad day.

293
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,639
What do you call it?

294
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,639
A heart attack.

295
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,639
Okay.

296
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,639
They own.

297
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:01,639
But you're very hard.

298
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:02,639
They attack you.

299
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,639
That's what I get.

300
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,639
That's what I get.

301
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:05,639
That's not what I get.

302
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,639
That's not what I get.

303
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,639
That's not what I get.

304
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
That's not what I get.

305
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:14,039
That's not what I get.

306
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:18,659
What country's capital is going the fastest in the world?

307
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,919
How do you not know this?

308
00:10:20,919 --> 00:10:23,759
You really don't know what.

309
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:30,159
Ireland, it's Dublin.

310
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:36,000
You're a comedic genius.

311
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,080
Somebody's about to make the sit.

312
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,080
What?

313
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:44,920
Alright.

314
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,000
What do tires reminisce about?

315
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,920
The times when I used to roll the good year.

316
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,920
That's actually good.

317
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
That's good.

318
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,920
That's good.

319
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,400
I don't think about the good year.

320
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Right.

321
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Again.

322
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Alright.

323
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,399
I don't know if you've heard the DJ use, is this belong?

324
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
No, I just don't.

325
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,399
There we go.

326
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,399
That public school education.

327
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,399
Oh no.

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,399
It's belong to Jeanine.

329
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:18,399
It's belong to Jeanine.

330
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,399
That's not how you spell belong to Jeanine.

331
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:23,399
What?

332
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:24,399
What did you say?

333
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,399
You used ball of Naga.

334
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,399
Ball of Naga?

335
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,399
No, it's belong to Jeanine.

336
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:28,399
Look at that.

337
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,399
Look at that.

338
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,399
Look at that.

339
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,399
Look at that.

340
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,399
He's better.

341
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,399
Never seen it.

342
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,399
Never seen it.

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,399
You're not a neat boy.

344
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:36,399
Never seen it.

345
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,399
I don't hate belong to you.

346
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,399
This is news to me.

347
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,399
I'm going to write this down.

348
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,399
Ballon, you got a personal.

349
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,399
Why did the DJ use Ballon instead of albums on his turntables?

350
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:50,399
Because you wanted to have a cold cut.

351
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,399
No.

352
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:52,399
Oh shit.

353
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,399
Yeah, that's actually right.

354
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:56,399
Because he wanted some cold cuts.

355
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,399
Yeah, that's good.

356
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,399
See?

357
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,399
I really didn't know that he's spelled belong.

358
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,399
That's the sound.

359
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:02,399
I wasn't thinking there.

360
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,399
That was a real dumb moment that you captured on camera.

361
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,399
It's doing what you want with that.

362
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:06,399
That's all you said.

363
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,399
Why now?

364
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,399
Why anime?

365
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,399
We both dads.

366
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:15,399
I mean, I always love when I can do content that my kids can enjoy.

367
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:19,399
I've seen you around your kid, you know?

368
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:20,399
Amazing father.

369
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,399
What's that?

370
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,399
Yeah, I mean, look, you're in the time of our lives where everything you do is for your kids.

371
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:26,399
Right?

372
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,399
We're out of the stages of caring for ourselves.

373
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,399
It's all about what can impact, what can impact, what will they like and enjoy.

374
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,399
Yeah.

375
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
So the more that you can do for them, the better.

376
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,399
You know, if this takes off and it gets to a place of merchandise, lunch boxes, backpacks,

377
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:52,399
you know, toys, anything in that space, I'll achieve an amazing goal, a personal one.

378
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,399
And, you know, to have them possibly be in a position where they can play with the things

379
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,399
that are reminiscent of their father or their father's old times.

380
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,399
It'll be huge, man.

381
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:10,399
So it's definitely kid-specific, you know, with a touch and passion of like my personal desire

382
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,399
to tap into all spaces in the entertainment business just to say that.

383
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,399
Yeah, and it's dope because it is a family show.

384
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,399
So the parents can't enjoy this as much as the kids.

385
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,399
Absolutely.

386
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
This style of humor that we got going right here.

387
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,399
What do you call...

388
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:30,399
There's some personal items.

389
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,399
What do you call low-cav with glasses?

390
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:38,399
What do I call low-cav with glasses?

391
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,399
I don't know.

392
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,399
Short, siding.

393
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,399
Okay.

394
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,399
I know you heard that, though.

395
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,399
That's what I know.

396
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,399
That's never heard that.

397
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,399
Because you short.

398
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,399
No, I get it.

399
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,399
Because it is near-siding.

400
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,399
I know what you're saying.

401
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,399
And it's far-sighted.

402
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,399
But you'll know, I get it.

403
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:56,399
Short.

404
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,399
I get it.

405
00:13:57,399 --> 00:13:58,399
I get it.

406
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,399
I get it because of the loud-cheek.

407
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:01,399
No, I'm not laughing, Nick, because it was stupid.

408
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,399
Okay?

409
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,399
That's why.

410
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,399
You know, I try to start a conversation with an elevator,

411
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
but it just let me down.

412
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,399
That's stupid.

413
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,399
It's delivery, then.

414
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,399
It's all the delinquents.

415
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,399
You got the good delivery of jokes going land.

416
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,399
Ain't no such thing as a bad dad, dude.

417
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,399
Oh, wow.

418
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:23,399
This is me.

419
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,399
No, no, you're right.

420
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:26,399
Okay.

421
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,399
What's one thing an orphan can't take?

422
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,399
Oh, God.

423
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:33,399
Oh, shit.

424
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:35,399
I'm sorry.

425
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,399
Family photo.

426
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:38,399
Oh, come on, man.

427
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,399
Come on, man.

428
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:40,399
I wrote this one.

429
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,399
Come on, man.

430
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,399
It's evil.

431
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,399
That can't be a dad, dude.

432
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,399
This is a bad joke.

433
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,399
I'm not worried about the dad joke.

434
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:50,399
There's one thing called orphanage.

435
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,399
A family.

436
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:52,399
He's just crazy.

437
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,399
A bitch with dad.

438
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,399
What is that?

439
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,399
What are we doing?

440
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,399
What is it?

441
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,399
We're ruining kids' lives.

442
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,399
There's no dodgers sign the Kool-Aid man.

443
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,399
You didn't know that?

444
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,399
I did not.

445
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,399
That's crazy.

446
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,399
He's a pitcher.

447
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,399
He's here because the Kool-Aid is in the pitcher.

448
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:11,399
Nobody?

449
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,399
Oh, yeah.

450
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:13,399
Busting through the wall.

451
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,399
That's a pitcher.

452
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,399
The Kool-Aid man is the natural pitcher.

453
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,399
You ain't got it.

454
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,399
I'm not a pitcher.

455
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:20,399
I'm not a pitcher.

456
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,399
I'm not a pitcher.

457
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:22,399
I'm not a pitcher.

458
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
You ain't got it.

459
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,399
It's waiting to meet you.

460
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,399
That's it.

461
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,399
You are a comedic.

462
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,399
Get number one fan.

463
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,399
Come on.

464
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,399
I could do this all day.

465
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:33,399
Besides, a little kid.

466
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,399
Who's your favorite character on the show?

467
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,399
Besides me, why do you like this?

468
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:38,399
Why do you like this?

469
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:39,399
Why do you like this?

470
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,399
I like this.

471
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,399
Why do you like this?

472
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,399
You know, I like this.

473
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,399
Of coursetekin won't be in the show because it's an amazing

474
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,399
talent that she is.

475
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,399
But seeing what Wanda was able to bring to the character.

476
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,240
I mean, that's dope man.

477
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
And you know, the world knows this.

478
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,360
They've seen us together for what?

479
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,919
Almost 30 years now.

480
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,840
And I didn't get a call or audition for a voice or no shit.

481
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,720
Because everybody knows what you sound like.

482
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,360
Everybody knows what the sights sound like.

483
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,480
I didn't think about that.

484
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
It's supposed to be my best friend for it.

485
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,840
I didn't think about that.

486
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,639
When you say it like that, I'm like damn.

487
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,639
I can't be the voice of the dog.

488
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,639
I can't.

489
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,840
Now, now, let's you say that.

490
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,120
I got kids too.

491
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,879
I just said, but now did you say the way you said it?

492
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,360
My kids want to enjoy this.

493
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,639
My kids are friends.

494
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,399
No, I got to get it.

495
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm going in the tank tank.

496
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,679
You ain't doing it.

497
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,600
No, because what you just said, everything I do, I include him.

498
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,439
No, and this is where we got to get better.

499
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:41,519
That's where we got to get better.

500
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,360
Yeah.

501
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,960
No, I got to get back to the dance.

502
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,480
OK.

503
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,319
I'm ready to do it.

504
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:45,799
I'm mad now.

505
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:46,319
I'm going to do this.

506
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I'm going to wait.

507
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,840
Rightfully so.

508
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,160
Rightfully so.

509
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,160
It's supposed to be my best friend.

510
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,240
For sure.

511
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,960
I just, I don't know where I found out that he had a car.

512
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,040
Turned his, I was turning on the TV.

513
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,960
Nobody let me know.

514
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,080
What's black and funny with curly hair that can be used

515
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,360
to start a barbecue grill?

516
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,880
Black, funny.

517
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,280
Curly hair can be used to start a barbecue grill?

518
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Sure, I'll end it.

519
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,280
What?

520
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
What's the answer?

521
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
That's exactly true.

522
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:31,280
You can go up your ass with saying that.

523
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,280
It's amazing.

524
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,720
A Dion Cole.

525
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
OK.

526
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,920
The sure one was funny.

527
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
OK.

528
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
Because that was a black.

529
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
No, OK.

530
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,920
I'm doing this.

531
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I thought that was real.

532
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
OK.

533
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
All right.

534
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Here we go.

535
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,759
Who's DoorDash's main competition when it comes to deliveries?

536
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,519
When it comes to deliveries, you don't notice?

537
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,560
DoorDash's main competition when it comes to deliveries.

538
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,840
Who's delivering more than DoorDash?

539
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,000
Nick Cannon.

540
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,080
It's a boy.

541
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,680
It's a girl.

542
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Twins.

543
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
That's a real adage.

544
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,680
I got a lot of kids, deliveries.

545
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I did it.

546
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
Yeah.

547
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
That was good.

548
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
But you didn't say it.

549
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Because I didn't get it at first.

550
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
I got it when you explained it.

551
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
All right.

552
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,680
That's probably the worst one of the show.

553
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,680
I don't know if you would say that.

554
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
That was horrible.

555
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
All right.

556
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
One, nothing funny about it.

557
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,680
Why are you talking about my kids?

558
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,680
I'm seeing this was supposed to be a good episode.

559
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,680
I'm coming here to support my friend.

560
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Now you want to talk about my personal life.

561
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,680
I have a lot of kids.

562
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,680
That's not funny.

563
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
I didn't write the die joke.

564
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm reading a Zona God damn paper.

565
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Somebody going to be fired.

566
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
Make fun of me.

567
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
I'm a good father.

568
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,680
I got to pick up some kids after this.

569
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
I think you're grateful.

570
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:56,680
Why didn't Lil Kav give a cheese steak to the woman

571
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,680
who had her purse though?

572
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,680
He heard she needed a hero.

573
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Okay.

574
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Okay.

575
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,680
That's it.

576
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,680
You done?

577
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,680
I'm going to do one more.

578
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,680
You're getting a...

579
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
You're getting a...

580
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
Okay.

581
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,680
All right.

582
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
Oh Nick, this is crazy.

583
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,680
You know I saw a baker break up with his girlfriend.

584
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:21,680
Yeah.

585
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,680
A baker.

586
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:23,680
A baker break up?

587
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,680
It broke up with his girlfriend.

588
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
It was just crazy.

589
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Right.

590
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,680
Yeah.

591
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,680
He said he needed space.

592
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
Think about it.

593
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,680
Think about it.

594
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I mean need it.

595
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,680
Yeah.

596
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,680
No.

597
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
It's not gonna be good.

598
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,680
Yeah.

599
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
Give me one more.

600
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,680
We overdeam ourselves with this.

601
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
These are ladders.

602
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Those are two that's last one.

603
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,680
Yeah.

604
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Yeah.

605
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,680
Yeah.

606
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
Yeah.

607
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Why didn't the bicycle go to the club?

608
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
Why?

609
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,680
Because it was too tired.

610
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,680
That's not that.

611
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,680
That's too tired.

612
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,680
That's not that.

613
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,680
That's not that.

614
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,680
That's not that.

615
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,680
That's not bad.

616
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Okay.

617
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,680
That's not bad.

618
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,680
We owe.

619
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,680
We don't go to the club no more.

620
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Too tired.

621
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
This is my culture.

622
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
This is my culture.

623
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,680
You know what?

624
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:09,680
I saw my bodybuilder a friend trying different sauces the other day.

625
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,680
I guess you could say those were weighted dips.

626
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
Bodybuilder.

627
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,680
There we have it ladies and gentlemen.

628
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:26,680
This has been an amazing episode of celebrity dad jokes with my so called best friend.

629
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,680
I want to talk to you about some stuff.

630
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
We're deadness.

631
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,680
I want to talk to you.

632
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,680
No cat.

633
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,680
No cat, man.

634
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Make sure you guys go watch it.

635
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Go streaming on BET Plus.

636
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Yeah.

637
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Dropping March 6th.

638
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,680
Man, you got to love the hustle and bustle of my amazing neighborhood.

639
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Hey, hey, hey.

640
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
Get ready to be amazed by your boy, little kid.

641
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
My little boy is growing up.

642
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
Get your stinkin' hands off of me.

643
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,680
Hey, that's my little brother Kevin you laughing at.

644
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,680
You got to be talking to him.

645
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
Hey, what's up?

646
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,680
This is M-C-E-R.

647
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Coming at you live.

648
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,680

649
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680

Hey, hey.

652
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Hey, hey.

653
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,680
Hey, hey.

654
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Hey, hey.

655
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Hey, hey.

656
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,680
It's going down, man.

657
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,680
I'm not in it.

658
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,680
Oh, well, come on, man.

659
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
That's ridiculous, Nick.

660
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,680
That's ridiculous.

661
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
But guess what?

662
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Season 2, huh?

663
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,680
I can audition.

664
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Well, we could talk.

665
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,680
Let's talk about what.

666
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:13,680
Sorry, guys.
