1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,839
What do you call a blonde that is still in the closet?

2
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:03,839
I don't know.

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:05,679
Last year's hide and seek champion.

4
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,839
I don't get it.

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:08,839
I don't know.

6
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:10,359
Hey, exactly!

7
00:00:10,359 --> 00:00:12,200
LAUGHTER

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:25,440
Oh, f***!

9
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,440
Oh, shit!

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, shit!

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,440
Oh, shit!

12
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,440
Oh, shit!

13
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,800
You see you too. You ready?

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
Yeah, ready. You excited first time, dad jokes table.

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,160
Dad jokes. Never time dad jokes before.

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,359
Oh, really?

17
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,840
A lot of memories on this table.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,960
Wait!

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,359
Where the f*** did everyone go?

20
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:41,880
LAUGHTER

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,640
Oh, my goodness!

22
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
Oh, my goodness!

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,640
What the f*** are these guys?

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,640
LAUGHTER

25
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,640
Hey.

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,240
Yeah, who's that? Who's that? Who's here?

27
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Oh, my gosh.

28
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,240
OK, so who?

29
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,480
I saw about that killer stage.

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,480
All right.

31
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,480
LAUGHTER

32
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:00,479
This is fate by rock.

33
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,479
Oh, OK.

34
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,479
I'll go first.

35
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:05,479
All right.

36
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,479
So I don't know what makes you laugh.

37
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:08,479
I'm going to...

38
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,479
I'll start off easy.

39
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:10,479
Yeah.

40
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,479
And then I'll go into the most f***ed up shit you've ever heard.

41
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,479
Yeah, that's true.

42
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,479
OK, so, why should you never take fungus on an aeroplane?

43
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:19,479
Because it smells?

44
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,479
No, because it takes up too much room.

45
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,479
LAUGHTER

46
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
That was really good.

47
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,480
That was really funny.

48
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
OK, OK.

49
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
No, that was good.

50
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
That was good. That was good.

51
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
Yeah, yeah.

52
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,480
LAUGHTER

53
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,480
That was off?

54
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Yeah.

55
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
Keep the ginseng off.

56
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
That was a mistake.

57
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:43,480
Do you know that Bruce Lee had a brother who was a vegan?

58
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Go on.

59
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,480
His name was Broccoli.

60
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
That's good.

61
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
That's good.

62
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
Oh, I'm sounding bad!

63
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Oh!

64
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,480
Broccoli!

65
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,480
LAUGHTER

66
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
So...

67
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
LAUGHTER

68
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Oh!

69
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
I'm only careful when the guys are back.

70
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
No, no, no, no, no.

71
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
It's my first time.

72
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Any other household?

73
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,480
She drove me.

74
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
Yeah, I know it.

75
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Yes, I was down here in Uber.

76
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
She's fine with it.

77
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,480
The Uber driver's driving to me over there.

78
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,480
That's all good, but...

79
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,479
I went into the codec store to steal something.

80
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,479
Yeah.

81
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,479
But I couldn't. They were cameras everywhere.

82
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,479
LAUGHTER

83
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,479
That was...

84
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,479
That was a lot.

85
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,479
That was a lot. That was a lot.

86
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,479
Oh, don't...

87
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:42,479
Oh, fuck.

88
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,479
You're so...

89
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,479
So the first time you got to go with...

90
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,479
Oh!

91
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:50,479
Oh!

92
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,479
Oh!

93
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,479
I make my mom...

94
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,479
I make my mom cry all the time, all right?

95
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Oh!

96
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,479
Oh, man!

97
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,479
That's good.

98
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:06,479
Oh!

99
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:08,479
No.

100
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,479
That's in your roasts.

101
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,479
OK.

102
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:13,479
So, I'm blaming you the staff here, you're the man.

103
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,479
Thanks, Ben.

104
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,479
No, you're the staff here.

105
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,479
No, no, no.

106
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,479
So, my Hawaiian pizza the other day.

107
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,479
I should have used a low-hear temperature.

108
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:28,479
Oh, come on, I'm just following you.

109
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,479
That was pretty good. That was good. That was good.

110
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,479
Yeah.

111
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:34,479
It's so awkward.

112
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,479
Talk me sad if you were in the back club.

113
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:38,479
Any dude you spoke to would have liked me.

114
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,479
Yeah, exactly.

115
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,479
Here's your bag.

116
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,479
I gave an Afghan purse to my daughter.

117
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,479
And she went, thanks for the bag, Dad.

118
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,479
Oh!

119
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,479
That was so good.

120
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,479
I have a doughnut apparently, and that's it.

121
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:57,479
Fuck bag.

122
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:59,479
Oh, my God.

123
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,479
You like it?

124
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,479
You finish it?

125
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,479
They're gonna get way worse.

126
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,479
OK.

127
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,479
What's black and always in the back of a cock-cub?

128
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
Rose of waxed.

129
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Now start again.

130
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Go again, go again.

131
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Go, go, go.

132
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,480
What's black and always in the back of a cock?

133
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,480
What?

134
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
The seat.

135
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
Oh, yes, yes.

136
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,480
Oh, it's coming.

137
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,480
It's coming.

138
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
It's coming.

139
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:44,480
What do you call an Indian who does not identify as any gender?

140
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
Non binary.

141
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,480
That's good.

142
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Did you get that from the comments?

143
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,480
I swear I read that in the comments before.

144
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
You still joke off.

145
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,480
I don't really know.

146
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,480
This lazy fox just got through the comments.

147
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
I hear it.

148
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
All right.

149
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
That's so fucking crazy that South Canary did.

150
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
That's so fucking crazy.

151
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,480
What's 12 inches long and hard in the morning?

152
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Wait, don't tell me.

153
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
Not South.

154
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,480
What do you call her?

155
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
The thing is that.

156
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,480
How do you call me just like that?

157
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,480
That's like a six-meter pot, that thing.

158
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Six?

159
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
You can do that.

160
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,480
12 inches is insane.

161
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,480
You had a four-kilo four-skit.

162
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Oh, thank you.

163
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,480
It's four kilos, but it's very small.

164
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,480
It's very small.

165
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,480
What card is an Iranian dictator drive?

166
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
A sedan who's saying.

167
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I wrote that.

168
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,480
You wrote that.

169
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I wrote the comments.

170
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,480
I think I saw it in the comments.

171
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,480
That was me, comedy.

172
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,480
South the best.

173
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,480
Knock knock.

174
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,480
Who's there?

175
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Cargo.

176
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Cargo who?

177
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Low-south.

178
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,480
Owls go who?

179
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,480
Cargo.

180
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Bip-bip.

181
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Bip-bip.

182
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
My car goes.

183
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
My car goes.

184
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,480
The most polite car.

185
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm just polite.

186
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Do I need it?

187
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Yeah, do it.

188
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,480
What do you call an Indian dating site?

189
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Kadek.

190
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Kadek the dots.

191
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,480
Oh my god.

192
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh my god.

193
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
I hit.

194
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
And now the racism comes.

195
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Oh fuck.

196
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
I'm a lady.

197
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, same.

198
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Can we just say, Peyton has a name on her phone?

199
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
She's like, what's your name?

200
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Peyton.

201
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,480
What?

202
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Oh wait.

203
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Are you alright?

204
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
Yeah.

205
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Quickly, quickly, have some vodka.

206
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,480
That's classic stuff.

207
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Classic stuff.

208
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,480
That's like how do you get up?

209
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Is it my turn?

210
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
Yeah, alright.

211
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,480
So a man walks into a zoo and he looks around and there's only a dog there.

212
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,480
It was a shitsoo.

213
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Yeah, I got to take that.

214
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
I'll take that.

215
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
That's good.

216
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Why was six afraid of seven?

217
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,480
I was going to say seven, eight, nine, but that's...

218
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
10 scared.

219
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Because he was right in the middle of 9-11.

220
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Oh my god damn.

221
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Oh, oh, oh.

222
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,480
Oh he's back.

223
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm back baby.

224
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Oh yeah.

225
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
That's a well-written joke.

226
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
I don't know.

227
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Peyton's gone down like towel one.

228
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Oh, me too.

229
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:18,480
Oh my god.

230
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
I'm sweaty.

231
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
I'm fucking sweaty.

232
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Oh my god.

233
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,480
I'm sweaty.

234
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I'm fucking sweaty.

235
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
That's my turn.

236
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Okay.

237
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Why English people bad at chess?

238
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Why?

239
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Because they lost their coin.

240
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Why can't the US play chess?

241
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Why?

242
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Because they lost their towers.

243
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,480
Hey!

244
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Oh man.

245
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
That was...

246
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,480
Call back.

247
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
Why can't my little brother play chess?

248
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Why?

249
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
He's not allowed any bishops.

250
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
He's back baby.

251
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
Yeah.

252
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
That's a pretty good joke.

253
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Can we get some more fun?

254
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
No, can we?

255
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,480
No.

256
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
I'm Kiera me.

257
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
Someone has to drive my car.

258
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Sure gun.

259
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Sure gun.

260
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Yeah.

261
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
You get it.

262
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
I'm not.

263
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480

264
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
I'm not.

269
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
I'm not.

270
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I'm not.

271
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,480
I'm not.

272
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
I'm not.

273
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm not.

274
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
I'm not.

275
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm not.

276
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
I'm not.

277
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
Oh fuck.

278
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,480
That's alright.

279
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Get him back.

280
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
You're in the bad rating.

281
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
I'm not.

282
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,480

283
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I'm not.

284
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
Alright, Blondjax.

285
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
A few Blondjax.

286
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Oh fuck.

287
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Here we go.

288
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
Hey.

289
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,480
He blocked.

290
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
What do you call a blonde that is still in the closet?

291
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
I don't know.

292
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
Last year's hide and seek champion.

293
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
I don't get it.

294
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,480
Exactly.

295
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
Oh man.

296
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480

297
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480

00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm not.

300
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
You're like a man up.

301
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
You're like a man up.

302
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
You're like a man up.

303
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
You're like a man up.

304
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
Yeah.

305
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Yeah.

306
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,480
Wow.

307
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Alright, you're done.

308
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Alright, you're done.

309
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Alright, you're done.

310
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I got it.

311
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,480
I got it.

312
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Now I've got the fucked up shit coming.

313
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,480
Oh.

314
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,480
What?

315
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Oh or I feel like I've said my best ones.

316
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
But anyways.

317
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Do you know what's clarious?

318
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,480
What?

319
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Catching a boss.

320
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
That's what I'm.

321
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I run that one myself.

322
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
You run that one.

323
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,680
It's just like, you know it's funny.

324
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,279
Because I never tried it before.

325
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,279
It's just like, you know it's funny.

326
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,800
Even if you will money your transport.

327
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,279
You know what, I think it's so funny.

328
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:24,519
You know what, I think it's so funny

329
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:26,519
when like poor people catch buses.

330
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,680
LAUGHTER

331
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,879
Oh, sorry guys, I just got to make a quick call.

332
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,480
Hello, is Mr. Wing there?

333
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,840
No. It's Mr. Wong there.

334
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,840
No.

335
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,600
I guess I winged the Wong number.

336
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,560
Oh, Jesus Christ.

337
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:46,559
That was so funny, man.

338
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,559
That was good.

339
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,559
That was all act out.

340
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,559
That was really good, man.

341
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,559
That was amazing.

342
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,559
Let me do another one.

343
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:57,559
No, that was a lot.

344
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:58,559
You loved it.

345
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,559
I loved it because we were so dumb.

346
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,559
I'm sorry.

347
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,559
You were a funny girl.

348
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,559
LAUGHTER

349
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:07,559
No.

350
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:08,559
That was cool.

351
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,559
That was cool.

352
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,559
What's the difference between Michael Phelps and Hitler?

353
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,559
Well.

354
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:17,559
Michael Phelps can finish a race.

355
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,559
Oh, my God.

356
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:20,559
That's like...

357
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,559
Why are you not even talking to this guy?

358
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,559
That's like...

359
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,559
Oh, my God.

360
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,559
Oh, my God. That's...

361
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,559
At least five laps.

362
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,559
No, I don't love.

363
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,559
That was shaking. You're on it.

364
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,559
Am I?

365
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,559
It's the closest he's been to boy woman in a while.

366
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:40,559
Yeah, my mom would be so unhappy right now.

367
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:43,559
Some of the labels is the movie South West.

368
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:46,559
LAUGHTER

369
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,559
There are eight years against you.

370
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,559
You feel safer, right?

371
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,559
Well, I'm good, but again, I'm really good.

372
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,559
You know what?

373
00:11:57,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Yeah, I signed a consent form before I went in.

374
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,559
Nothing makes a girl feel safer than God.

375
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,559
Hey, you feel safer.

376
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:04,559
You're like, goody, yeah?

377
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:05,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

378
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,559
I'm good.

379
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,559
Yeah, you signed a consent form, so it's like...

380
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:09,559
Am I really?

381
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:11,559
I'm really, really...

382
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,559
Oh, my God.

383
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:15,559
Go, bus, go.

384
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,559
Bus, go.

385
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,559
Bus, go.

386
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:18,559
Um...

387
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,559
Like they said, boss, not boss.

388
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,559
Can't be a boss on it.

389
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:24,559
Exactly.

390
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,559
Exactly.

391
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:26,559
You can be a boss on a boss.

392
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,559
Can you?

393
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,559
Yeah.

394
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,559
I call.

395
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,559
I call.

396
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:31,559
Don't worry.

397
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,559
Why couldn't Stephen Hawking play basketball?

398
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,559
No, no, no.

399
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:36,559
Because he's white.

400
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,559
But...

401
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,559
So, I think it's right.

402
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,559
I can't play.

403
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,559
I can't play.

404
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:43,559
Rachel.

405
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:44,559
I touch kids.

406
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:45,559
Fuck that guy.

407
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,559
That's it.

408
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:48,559
I'm going to see myself out of here.

409
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,559
You said I touch kids with their own hands.

410
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:53,559
Okay, you made me laugh, son.

411
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:54,559
Did I?

412
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,559
Yeah.

413
00:12:55,559 --> 00:12:56,559
Yeah.

414
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:57,559
I love that.

415
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,559
I love that.

416
00:12:58,559 --> 00:12:59,559
I love that.

417
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:00,559
I love that.

418
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,559
I love that.

419
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:02,559
I love that.

420
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:03,559
I love that.

421
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:04,559
I love that.

422
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:05,559
Yeah.

423
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,559
This is the craziest one.

424
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,559
I don't think I've been on a crazy...

425
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:10,559
Is that what you're doing?

426
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:11,559
Yeah, this is great.

427
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:12,559
Yeah, this is fun.

428
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:13,559
Okay.

429
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,559
Soak spring the children, but which bird prevents children?

430
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,559
What?

431
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:19,559
Swallow.

432
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:20,559
Oh.

433
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,559
That's a boat for swallowing.

434
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,559
What do you call a line of people at a gay bar?

435
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:29,559
An LGBTQ?

436
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,559
That was great.

437
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:34,559
That was great.

438
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,559
That was great.

439
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:36,559
That was great.

440
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:37,559
No, it's good.

441
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:39,559
The line of funny, but you like it.

442
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,559
You have one more.

443
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,559
You have one more.

444
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,559
This is really dumb.

445
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,559
So, a Spanish guy, right?

446
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:46,559
Do you speak Spanish?

447
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
See.

448
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:48,559
See me, man.

449
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,559
Okay, so a Spanish guy goes to Ireland and he walks into a bar.

450
00:13:53,559 --> 00:13:57,559
And he sits down at the bar and the Spanish guy turns to the Irish guy sitting there and goes,

451
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,559
What's your name?

452
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,559
And the Irish guy turns around and he's like, it's Michael O'Brien.

453
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,559
And the Spanish guy goes, What?

454
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:04,559
He said, Michael O'Brien.

455
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,559
Go to the Spanish, so I don't get it.

456
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:10,559
But if you're Spanish, you get it.

457
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,559
I'll tell you something.

458
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,559
I'll tell you something.

459
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,559
I'll tell you something.

460
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,559
Hey!

461
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,559
Okay.

462
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:18,559
All right, well, you still laughed.

463
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,559
I did laugh.

464
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:26,559
What do you call an Asian guy with a big ***?

465
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,559
A sleep, because that motherfucker's dreaming.

466
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,559
Oh my God.

467
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,559
Oh my God.

468
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:38,559
Fuck it.

469
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,559
Cut the tape.

470
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:40,559
Cut the tape.

471
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:41,559
All right, last one.

472
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:42,559
Last one.

473
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:43,559
I'm not even going to show it.

474
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:44,559
All right, all right.

475
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:45,559
You made me the whole.

476
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:47,559
I felt like I was talking about nature.

477
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:48,559
Oh my God.

478
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:49,559
Okay.

479
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:52,559
I said, like, say a joke with an awkward joke, I appreciate it.

480
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,559
What do you call a white man with a big ***?

481
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:56,559
Michael Jackson.

482
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,559
Hee hee.

483
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,559
Hee hee.

484
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,559
I can't believe it.

485
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,559
I can't believe it.

486
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:06,559
Oh yeah!

487
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,559
Woo!

488
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:08,559
Yeah!

489
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,559
Another white woman winning in life.

490
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,559
Fuck yes.

491
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,559
I'm sorry.

492
00:15:17,559 --> 00:15:20,559
What are you fucking you and camera?

493
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:21,559
Hey!
