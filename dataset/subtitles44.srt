1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What's the difference between Iron Man and Iron Woman?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
One's a superhero, one's a command.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, thanks, guys.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Oh, no.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
OK.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hi.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hello.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
OK, Karen.

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Come in there.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It's a star.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's not it.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yeah, no? You're good.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
They don't pay attention. We're fine.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And I think we've started.

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
One whole.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
One whole. OK.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Um, says paper rock or do you have a preference?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Says paper rock.

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
OK.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Says paper rock.

24
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Says paper rock.

25
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
All right. You're up and asking.

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm fair.

27
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't lie, probably.

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Fist me.

29
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
OK.

30
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm so good. Glucinators.

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It's not going to go well with it.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
That's good. That's good. Keep that energy up.

33
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No.

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Um, what do anniversaries, the toilet bowl,

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
and the clitoris all have in common?

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What?

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Men usually miss them all.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, you can't look at me.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Can't look at me as if you said.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Now, getting you so you don't look at me.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Shall I be in your...

45
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're laughing.

46
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
No.

47
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
See me in the back.

49
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
All right.

50
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Good start.

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yeah.

52
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One chicken.

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It cannot pause it either.

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Stop laughing at me.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you a virgin?

57
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Shut up.

58
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Jeez.

59
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Yep.

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Yep.

61
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Did you hear about the guy who dipped his nuts?

63
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, no.

64
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, shit.

65
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh, shit.

67
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, shit.

68
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, shit.

70
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Oh, shit.

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, shit.

72
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Oh, shit.

74
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yeah, yeah.

75
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Yeah, had me in nuts.

78
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know whether to try the turkey again or just leave it.

79
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I try to get it.

80
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
OK, because I already fucked it.

81
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
That's what he was right.

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Right.

83
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
OK, get it.

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
OK.

86
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Did you hear about the guy who dipped his balls in glitter?

87
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Pretty nuts, eh?

88
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's not even good.

89
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
This is a pretty...

90
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah.

91
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This is a pretty nuts.

92
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Never looked at anyone.

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, pretty.

94
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hmm.

95
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Ah.

96
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What do both men and public toilets have in common?

97
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What?

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They're both either busy or full of shit.

100
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I hope this is your humour, because I really kind of tailor it.

102
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This is all of these...

103
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Men hating men.

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Does that work?

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Like, men hating men kind of things?

107
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Fuck off.

109
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Give me the crack, anyway.

110
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We have literally one minute in.

111
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And...

112
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, this is...

113
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, fuck.

114
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's bad.

115
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's bad.

116
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Cheers.

117
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What's the difference between my dad and my dog?

118
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm like a dad now.

119
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I don't know.

120
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My dog returned home after going for a walk.

121
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh.

122
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's good.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, I made it in me.

124
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He said that I was gay.

125
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Did that story?

126
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fuck.

127
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't know what dad is going to stop talking.

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, he genuinely did.

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
My dad met, and was like,

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So what's your sexuality?

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What even did this?

132
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
And Matt was like, I'm a big old question mark.

133
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yeah, I'll say that, yeah.

134
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's like...

136
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We're going to come in now.

137
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
These backstories are funny even in the job.

138
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We'll get through one joke soon.

140
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think I need to like, like, ask my big son, is there a cannot...

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, what do you call a man with half a brain?

142
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Matt?

143
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
A gifted man.

144
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Matt.

145
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I also said not.

146
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Oh.

147
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Did I laugh at that too?

148
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't know.

149
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No, you definitely did.

150
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah, you kept the gathering on.

151
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yeah.

152
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You get to it?

153
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't get it.

154
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The man with half a brain is like quite intelligent for a man.

155
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Just like that.

156
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh, gosh.

157
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm not sure.

158
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Right.

159
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Do you know why birds fly south in the winter?

160
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Because it's too cold to walk.

161
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm doing genuine real dad jokes this time.

162
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Apparently that's not the vibe.

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You should think funny one.

164
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thanks.

165
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sorry, I don't have a prison sentence to use for humour.

166
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Um...

167
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What's it?

169
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know what I'd say that and then slink back in the chair

170
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and put the studies on a bit out of your ears?

171
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Well, what's the difference between Iron Man and Iron Woman?

172
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
One's a superhero, one's a command.

174
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I really like that one.

175
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That's great.

176
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I really find cocaine jokes funny.

177
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But occasionally a one-liner does make me snort.

178
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's good one, I really like that one.

179
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I really like that one.

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Fuck off!

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, Jesus.

182
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What's the score on this one, me?

183
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It's just five.

184
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's five.

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
That's losing.

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
No, I think I'm losing.

187
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No, no.

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What do you call an Aussie gaslighting woman?

189
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What?

190
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Abby, you never said toy.

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And you backed her up.

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You were a gaslighter bitch as well.

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You could've used gaslighter and Aussie bitches.

195
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, no.

196
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No, okay, but...

197
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I questioned it and I was like, did I say toy?

198
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because I wasn't sure.

199
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And then she said I did.

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Or her too.

201
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You never said it.

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think they edited it out.

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm really sorry.

204
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You were right.

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
No, I want to see the raw footage.

206
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I want to see the raw and edited footage.

207
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was at my boss's funeral, kneeling next to the coffin,

210
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
when I got removed from the funeral.

211
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Apparently, whispering,

212
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
who's thinking outside the box now, Gary,

213
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
isn't funeral appropriate.

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why women's baseball game is dangerous?

215
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Why?

216
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Because pictures be crazy.

218
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I like them.

219
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's good.

220
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yeah.

221
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I have been looking for my exes killer for years.

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Been old to it.

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't get that one.

224
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Still thinking about the pictures be crazy.

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Can you do it again for me, please?

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I've been looking for my exes killer for years.

227
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But...

228
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What's you?

229
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
No?

232
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm not listening.

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's the understanding.

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah.

235
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah.

236
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, he did.

237
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yeah, I did.

238
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why is it so hard to argue with a woman that's not wearing a bra?

239
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's already made two really good points.

241
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
We just did him to make him say.

242
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I meant to discline him.

243
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't even likeupbeat picture.

244
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I wasn't trying to journal with that contract.

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That was big thing, devil.

246
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I forget about that.

247
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I forgot about that.

248
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It was interesting.

249
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
And now I will tell you an interesting story.

250
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Bucket gardening?"

251
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I haven't known this story for a long time,

252
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ah.

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ah.

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Did you hear about the surgeon who was five the other day?

255
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
No.

256
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Uh, turns out the weight or man's heart is not through his stomach.

257
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Does it go on?

258
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thanks.

259
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What are the four words which are sure?

260
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Sorry.

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
That was a cough.

262
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That was a cough. That was a cough.

263
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It was a cough.

264
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Ah.

265
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Ah.

266
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Ah.

267
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Fuck that. Jesus.

268
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

269
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Very sorry.

270
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay, where are we at?

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You're probably...

272
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Yeah.

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
One of four words which are sure,

274
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
fire away to demolish your man's ego.

275
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Not your dick, small?

276
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm cute.

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh, yeah.

278
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh.

279
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Oh.

280
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Is it in yet?

281
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Hmm. Same point.

282
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
No.

283
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Oh, why do you know a fan's head of bars and bars?

284
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Tell the joke, yeah, I got it.

285
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
His mat's barred from all bars.

286
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's not actually the punchline.

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't know why I think that's...

288
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's mean.

289
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, I'm going to say the game.

290
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'll have the shocks at last.

291
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's mean.

292
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's mean.

293
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mean widget.

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Back.

295
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ready.

296
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Why do you never find them in bars?

297
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just wait for the chorus.

298
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The peanut gallery room.

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hmm.

300
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, say the joke again for him.

301
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I want to hear the end of that.

302
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Why do you never find petafiles and bars?

303
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, yeah.

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Terrible place to pick up a date.

305
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hmm.

306
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
One big difference between men and women is that when women say

307
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
smell this, it usually smells nice.

308
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Smell it.

309
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It's a smell.

310
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm so sorry.

311
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Did you just say smell my finger?

312
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yeah. It's pour my finger.

313
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The joke was about smelly.

314
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, I know. But why would I smell your finger?

315
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's not a bad one.

316
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're not a bad one.

317
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You're not a bad one.

318
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's not a bad one.

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's not a bad one.

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You're not a bad one.

321
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, you're not a bad one.

322
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Yeah, it's not a bad one.

323
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What's this call?

324
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
10.

325
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Oh, so we've already finished.

326
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay.

327
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Just finish the bottle while you're out of it.

328
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Six again, big boy.

329
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Let's get.

330
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Big boy.

331
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're so sorry.

332
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

333
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You're so sorry.

334
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
So you're not like you were joking up here.

335
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That one is not like you were just me joking up.

336
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
No, I'm not.

337
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm not.

338
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
They'll tell you what, Andrew.

339
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
When we get to rent, we'll have a little joke off.

340
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
joke off?

341
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Can't be.

342
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm down.

343
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm down.

344
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Yeah.

345
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Joke off?

346
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm going to be black.

347
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're not already black?

348
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am.

349
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What is 6.9?

350
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Going.

351
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
A good thing, ruined by a period.

352
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Mm-hmm.

353
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mm-hmm.

354
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Mm-hmm.

355
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Damn it!

356
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The paint on the gallery makes it very difficult.

357
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mm-hmm.

358
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I guess that's the point.

359
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We have none.

360
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Tee.

361
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So sorry. Is your official name a killer of the girl?

362
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
No.

363
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Is the most I've loved in any episode ever.

364
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Mm.

365
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What's the difference between an apple and an orphan?

366
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You've done this one and an apple gets picked.

367
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
That is correct.

368
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That is correct.

369
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You've done it before yourself, man.

370
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Yeah, it was really your joke.

371
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You did it with Sambia, even a remembering.

372
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I see.

373
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Is that dark?

374
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We...

375
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, what I got, what I got, what I got.

376
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You just...

377
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Okay.

378
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What's the difference?

379
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh my.

380
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I just need a joke and three...

381
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You did this already.

382
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I can't!

383
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You can't take a joke.

384
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I can't.

385
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But you take three cups.

386
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I can't.

387
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You're not gonna do that.

388
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're not gonna do that.

389
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I can't do that.

390
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Abbie, what?

391
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No!

392
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Alright, trust me out.

393
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Thanks.

394
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I did the couch, the day from first shot.

395
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Look at that.

396
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Dude, we have to use the bottle of wine.

397
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Love you.

398
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't think I've ever laughed up much in one of these.

399
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yeah.
