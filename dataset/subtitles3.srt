1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
And can you look at a cartoon and come up with a voice?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,040
Well, like with happy feet, I got to be, like,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,440
I played two different characters.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,439
Initially three, but then there were that

5
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:10,640
the one voice sounded too familiar.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,839
But when I got to play in Argentina and Penguin,

7
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,480
I was to play the little machismo penguin,

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
you know, the guys, the Argentinian guys were going,

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:20,920
what do you know you want it?

10
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,480
What do you look at it? Do you know you want it?

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,080
Look at it. Don't be afraid of the flippers.

12
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,920
I know.

13
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,960
I brought you some pebbles.

14
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,760
There's some bling, baby. You want some bling.

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,360
You know you're doing...

16
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,120
yet you're hard and you know I got a beak

17
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,359
that'll make you feel so good.

18
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:35,359
LAUGHTER

19
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:37,960
And then you had like, oh, the crazy ones, you know?

20
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,560
APPLAUSE

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,640
Listen, talking about a machin, we got people

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,000
on our audience to draw cartoons of themselves.

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,200
Oh, no.

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,359
I'm sensing, I'm sensing self-esteem issues.

25
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:53,359
Where?

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,359
Let's see.

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,359
Now, oh, no.

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,640
Now, God forbid, when I ask to see this woman in the audience,

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,640
she looks like this.

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
You better not put that up on a candle.

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
It's like the best found the state.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,840
I will be on you like, shit on Velcro.

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,840
LAUGHTER

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,439
Yeah.

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,240
Oh, fingers crossed.

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Fingers crossed.

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,439
OK, show the picture.

38
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,439
This is the lady.

39
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:22,040
LAUGHTER

40
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,640
That her name is Jane Hayes.

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,640
Jane Hayes?

42
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,640
Now let's have a look at Jane in the flesh.

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Jane.

44
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,640
Jane, you're beautiful, Jane.

45
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Jane, you're not a gay black basketball player.

46
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
LAUGHTER

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,239
It's very thought for Sally Jenkins and I think her husband.

48
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,240
But it's Sally.

49
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
LAUGHTER

50
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,840
Where's Sally?

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,439
Sally suffers from paperclip kits.

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,439
Oh!

53
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:53,439
Sally, you look quite box-um.

54
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
With your funny little terrier ears.

55
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,439
Oh, and for some reason you've drawn a penis on your own face.

56
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,439
LAUGHTER

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,439
Why she's done that?

58
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,439
She's done a penis with two tiny balls.

59
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:08,439
And what are those those that, well, I don't know,

60
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,439
there's two upside-down bells.

61
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,439
Oh, my God.

62
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,439
Is that your husband, Jane?

63
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:15,439
That's you.

64
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,439
Yeah.

65
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:18,439
And you're naked as well.

66
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,439
Yeah.

67
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,439
What's that strange line?

68
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,439
Yeah, but more importantly, what's peeking out here?

69
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,439
Are those your two balls going, I'm down here.

70
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:32,439
And why did you have an accordion for a night?

71
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,439
Oh, yes.

72
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:34,439
You watched them with the nails.

73
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,439
She was drunk.

74
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,439
I don't know. We were drunk.

75
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:39,439
You're a chef.

76
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,439
Yeah.

77
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:41,439
Who else, my God?

78
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:43,439
Actually, I quite have seen this woman.

79
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:44,439
Stephanie Jack.

80
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,439
Where's Stephanie Jack?

81
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:47,439
Hello, Stephanie Jack.

82
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,439
There's Stephanie Jack in the flesh and here she's in the cartoon.

83
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,439
LAUGHTER

84
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,439
It's my brother.

85
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,439
Do you see a great Japanese anime character?

86
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,439
He's a teacher lot to come to your house.

87
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:11,439
See how the big eyes come to your house with a larger breast,

88
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:13,439
open the door with her nipple.

89
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,439
Look at those.

90
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:16,439
Ham and ham and ham and ham.

91
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:18,439
This bouncing breast.

92
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,439
Follow the bouncing breast.

93
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:22,439
Wow.

94
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,439
That's kind of what... Can I have this one?

95
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,439
Yes, you can.

96
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,439
It's been on the road for a while.

97
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,439
Why were you having the...

98
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,439
Was it a deep tissue massage you were having?

99
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:36,439
Where are you going with this, Green?

100
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:39,439
When are you having a Turkish massage or something?

101
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,439
I don't know what it has to do with what we're talking about.

102
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:43,439
It's a funny story, tell it.

103
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,439
I had an awful experience having a Turkish massage

104
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,439
where this guy's idea of massage

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,439
was to take my one leg and the other arm and try and connect it

106
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,439
behind my back.

107
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:05,439
And I was kind of like... You know, like that.

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,439
And then I... Well, his belly went in my mouth.

109
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,439
Oh, he did.

110
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,439
It was like a little brat.

111
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,439
You know what?

112
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,439
And you know when you get something weird in your mouth

113
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,120
and you're like, if you're eating something, you go like you send your brain

114
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,120
send your tongue to figure out what it is.

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,120
I don't know.

116
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,439
It's not a conscious thought. It's just like, is that a bone? Figure that out.

117
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,439
The tongue goes in to figure it out.

118
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,439
My tongue was like, what is that?

119
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,439
It's a hairy belly.

120
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,439
Sounds like you're heading off a newspapers.

121
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,439
Now, Amelia Clark, did you get to chat with everyone backstage?

122
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:44,439
Yeah, kind of.

123
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,439
Amelia Clark loves Matt.

124
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:50,439
Love, love, love.

125
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:52,439
Hi.

126
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,439
Hi.

127
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,439
I was blushing.

128
00:04:56,439 --> 00:04:59,439
Yeah, we just think you're wicked.

129
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,439
Oh.

130
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,439
It's a game of two halves.

131
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,439
I'll be coming next weekend.

132
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:07,439
Oh, yeah.

133
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,439
You returning the favour, do you watch Game of Thrones, Matt?

134
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,439
I watch it the first season and then I kind of fell out of it

135
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,439
and I tried to watch it this season.

136
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,439
That's okay, that's okay.

137
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,439
And I don't know what's going on.

138
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,439
There's lots of stuff going on.

139
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,439
It's so much going on.

140
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:21,439
There is.

141
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,439
It's okay.

142
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:25,439
I could lie, but I don't want to lie.

143
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,439
No, no, no, no.

144
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,439
You've seen the good bits.

145
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,439
You've seen the fast season.

146
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,439
It's all down here.

147
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,439
What is it? It's season six now.

148
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,439
It's season six.

149
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
And it's bigger than ever.

150
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:39,439
Who's lost?

151
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:42,439
That seriously sounds like a chicken.

152
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,439
I could have won that.

153
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
It's been really a while.

154
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,439
It's a studio.

155
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,439
It's a comedy.

156
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,439
I eat them as good as stop because I thought there was a mechanical fault

157
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:49,439
with something.

158
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,439
But that's a human being.

159
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,439
Oh, is that man there?

160
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:56,439
Oh, well, I'm glad you're having a nice time.

161
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,439
Yeah, get up.

162
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,439
I was once that song was...

163
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,439
No, no, I know.

164
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:04,439
I do have one request for me, though.

165
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:05,439
What's that?

166
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:07,439
So, would you be able to ask me how I'm doing?

167
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,439
Oh, bestie.

168
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:14,439
You can say no.

169
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,439
Everyone will hate you, but you can say no.

170
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,439
No, yes.

171
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:22,439
Well, since I haven't been up to speed on the show, I will say...

172
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:23,439
Yes, thank you.

173
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:24,439
How you doing?

174
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:27,439
I caught that.

175
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,439
It was.

176
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,439
It was.

177
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,439
There are some scenes where they will play music maybe a bit of it.

178
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,439
If it's a wide shot and it's not like...

179
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:42,439
So, it's the closest we get to sort of kind of sort of just sort of going forward in one piece.

180
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:44,439
And they'll play music or something.

181
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:47,439
And my temptation is always just to try to make the cuttle-off.

182
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,439
So, sometimes I'll do things like when there's a moment where I'm meant to, you know, orgasm,

183
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:56,439
I'll be like, do-do-do-do-do.

184
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,439
People do that.

185
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,439
Wait.

186
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,439
Which one of the way, if they don't, they should.

187
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,439
It's like a Ryan Air flight when a Ryan Air flight lands.

188
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,439
Like, give it a little.

189
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,439
Oh, no, no, no.

190
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,439
Well, people travel.

191
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:17,439
You know, they collect things, postcards, dolls and national dress.

192
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,439
But you collect, like animals, like living animals.

193
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:26,439
Well, no, I don't collect them. I rescue them.

194
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,439
Oh, okay.

195
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,439
So, did you rescue anything when you were in Sicily and Tuscany?

196
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,439
Not in that one, but in the movie I did right after in Bulgaria, I did.

197
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,439
Okay.

198
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:45,439
And I had promised my husband I was going to stop because at the time I had ten dogs, five parrots,

199
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,439
I had alpacas, horses, cats.

200
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:56,439
And by the way, one without a tail, the other one without a leg, you know.

201
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:58,439
And they always, they find me.

202
00:07:58,439 --> 00:08:01,439
They come to me, these animals, which he doesn't really me, but they do.

203
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,439
And I promise him no more, okay?

204
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,439
We were up to thirty animals.

205
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,439
I swore no more.

206
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:15,439
And I was there, and a little puppy who was abandoned and was going to die.

207
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,439
I won't tell you the sad story because it's a comedic show and Alstagg, right?

208
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,439
He came to me and I couldn't help it and I picked him up.

209
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:30,439
And his name is Ochoa after the goalie of the soccer team in Mexico, it was a walk-up.

210
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:37,440
And I took him and then I was terrified, how am I going to explain this to my husband, I promised, I promised.

211
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:44,440
And so I came up with this brilliant idea to pretend that I was having an affair.

212
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,440
And then, no, with somebody to make him think I was having an affair, and at the end I would say,

213
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,440
it's not an affair, I picked up a dog and then he would feel better.

214
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
I picked up a dog.

215
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
This is clever, it's not an affair.

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
So I left him a message, you must call me at this time, we need to talk.

217
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,440
It's very important.

218
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,440
And I never do that and this time it's okay, what happened, what happened?

219
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
And I said, listen, I feel so terrible.

220
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,440
I don't know how to say this to you.

221
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,440
And I know this is not going to go down well and I'm really nervous.

222
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:28,440
And please have mercy on me, you have patience, be understanding, it's just, it's been so stressful and I'm so tired.

223
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,440
And I was so lonely here for so many days and you know you do crazy things when you're in this state.

224
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
And he said to me, oh please don't tell me you picked up another dog.

225
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:48,440
What I'm afraid of is you can conjure up people's fears.

226
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
Yes.

227
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:53,440
So you're afraid of basic things.

228
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm afraid of like most things, like anything high risk I'm terrified of.

229
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
But those irrational things.

230
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:05,440
Okay, irrational is the expiders because they actually, I become paralyzed when I have a spider in my room.

231
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,440
Really? Yeah, I wish I were tougher than that but I'm not.

232
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Okay, now, small gruffloat, we use serious when you told us what your fear is.

233
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
I mean it's a good fear.

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
I think it's a founded fear.

235
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
I think it's a founded fear.

236
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
It is.

237
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Tell us what it is.

238
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I have a phobia of being chased around with poop on a stick.

239
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,440
That's fair.

240
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I wouldn't say we've all got that fear.

241
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
There's another one that goes, not a lot for that.

242
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,440
It started when I was a kid.

243
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:45,440
It was just weird parenting.

244
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:52,440
For some reason, kids thought it was funny to stick a stick and dog poop and chase each other around with it.

245
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,440
But that scared the crap out of me.

246
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Because of the cleanliness problem of it?

247
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
No, because of the poop.

248
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,440
It's just dogs poop.

249
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,440
It's just a prank of sticks.

250
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Now, Jeremy Ranado, yours is brilliantly specific and I think without knowing it,

251
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I think we probably all share it.

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
We may.

253
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I don't know.

254
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I didn't have the fear when I was younger because we all go through this but it's when a little child,

255
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,440
and I'm the oldest of seven kids and I got a lot of little rug rests running around.

256
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,440
And these little roaches start losing their teeth.

257
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,440
And they get a little wiggly and they like to show me like this little dagger flipping it in and out of their mouth.

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
And like, look out there, Jeremy, I want to pull this thing out.

259
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
I'm like, I can get out of here.

260
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,440
You're freaking me out.

261
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
But don't you think that is really freaky?

262
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,440
I mean, it's like...

263
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,440
It's like her thumb.

264
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I just read it.

265
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,440
It's just again.

266
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,440
No.

267
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
No.

268
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
It's just really kind of gross to me.

269
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
I have the cutest little thing on the planet.

270
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
It starts to do the creepiest thing on the planet.

271
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,440
And I'm like, get out of here.

272
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,440
I'm like, you're tied to string to my thing to the door knob.

273
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,440
I'm like, get out of here. Creep.

274
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
You got to be an animal?

275
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm gonna be an animal for the year of the stage.

276
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
That's now.

277
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
No!

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
The other one's running around flipping their little teeth on out.

279
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Look, we all have this...

280
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,440
You know, you have the dreams, you're teeth full out.

281
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I don't know what it means.

282
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,440
Does anybody want a means?

283
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,440
We get bigger than ones.

284
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,440
No, you have bad dreams.

285
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Am I the only one that has bad dreams?

286
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,440
No, we're your dreams.

287
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,440
I've written a line just had that dream too.

288
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Just a brandy of words.

289
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,440
Yeah, not me.

290
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,440
What does that mean?

291
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,440
I don't know.

292
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
This is strange.

293
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
I'm sure of money, I think.

294
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I think that's what the two call it.

295
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
Who does fear of money?

296
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Where is the other freedom you think?

297
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,440
Maybe I'm just afraid of my teeth fucking falling out.

298
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Guys, that's just what you're up to.

299
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
What are you afraid of?

300
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Well, I was gonna go with flying,

301
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,440
but I think I'll go with...

302
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Girls over 12?

303
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,440
You're fucking me.

304
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,440
You're fucking me.

305
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm fucking me.

306
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,440
Come on, give up that blow.

307
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Give up.

308
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Give up that blow.

309
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
Give up.

310
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
You're a terrible...

311
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I don't know what came over me.

312
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
I'm not gonna lie to you.

313
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I'm not gonna lie to you.

314
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,440
The last minute of my life, I wouldn't have predicted that.

315
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,440
How was it, Mark Ruffalo?

316
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
You're not gonna believe what he said to me.

317
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,440
But he was bang on the money.

318
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,440
He's a very perceptive man.

319
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,440
It was the Dara poem.

320
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Don't try and justify it.

321
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Do you know what?

322
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I've always hated the Hulk. He's shit.

323
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
You're making me angry.

324
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,440
Yeah, you would let me one of angry Ruffalo.

325
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,440
My son stood up to me the other day when he was mad at me.

326
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
What do you all like him?

327
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I always hated the Hulk. I think he's shit.

328
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,440
What is the hold that the spice girls have over you?

329
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
Is this real?

330
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,440
I just feel like I've been talking more about the spice girls on this press tour than I have about the movie.

331
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
You went to Australia.

332
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I did. I know. I wept.

333
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Did you really wept?

334
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,440
I really did.

335
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
But now which one was talking to you?

336
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
Melby.

337
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,440
What she really told you was a message.

338
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
No, it was a video message on an iPad.

339
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
And that made you cry.

340
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Yes!

341
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,440
Were you jet lagged?

342
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Yes!

343
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
But I also...

344
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
You do understand because we're in the UK.

345
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
I was a fiend.

346
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,440
I was obsessed with the spice girls.

347
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
And they taught me about girl power.

348
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,440
And I love them.

349
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,440
I think they're fantastic.

350
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
And I...

351
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,440
What's the song?

352
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
There's so many, Jamie.

353
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,440
There's so many.

354
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
That was a good one.

355
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,440
No, I'll set your life.

356
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
Every boy and every girl.

357
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I'll set your life.

358
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,440
No!

359
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
There's so many.

360
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,440
And they're so fantastic.

361
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
And today on the radio, Melcy talked to me over Skype.

362
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Oh, wow!

363
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
So it's really very exciting.

364
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay, that...

365
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,440
Who would you say is your favorite spice girl?

366
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Emma Bunton, baby spice.

367
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
She's your favorite.

368
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
She's my favorite.

369
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Who's next?

370
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,440
Oh!

371
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Do you have to do that?

372
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,440
Just a question.

373
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
All of the other four.

374
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,440
So Emma Bunton?

375
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Well, Emma Bunton was the one that I had blonde hair and bangs.

376
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
And my name, obviously, is...

377
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
Now Emma.

378
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
My name was Emily, but it was taken...

379
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
When I became an actor.

380
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
And so...

381
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Now it's Emma.

382
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
And, yeah, I just...

383
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,440
I love...

384
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
So give me this.

385
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,440
So you won't give you a video message and want to talk to you on Skype.

386
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Yes.

387
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,440
But are you telling me you've never met a spice girl?

388
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,440
Are you gonna do something?

389
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Have you never met a spice girl?

390
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,440
Are you gonna do something really?

391
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Have you never met a spice girl?

392
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,440
I'm... wait, hold on.

393
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,440
I have to mention I compare myself.

394
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Have you never met a spice girl?

395
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,440
Not in the flesh.

396
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay.

397
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Now, as you know...

398
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,440
Go!

399
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,440
As you know...

400
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,440
As you know, Emma...

401
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,440
It's very rare...

402
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:17,440
It's very rare for more than one spice girl to appear together...

403
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,440
For any reason at all.

404
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
So, they're not here.

405
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Oh!

406
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Oh!
