1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,680
Slickdog's a new album, Bush.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,440
And a very sexy bit of PR.

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,040
Of course, the mighty Farell, he co-wrote...

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,200
Do you write a whole song?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,320
He produced the whole album.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,359
Produced the whole album.

7
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,640
Yes, sir. Wow.

8
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,120
Now, is it true that Farell,

9
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
he was the one encouraging you

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:18,800
to be a bit more family-friendly,

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
a bit more mainstream-wise?

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,920
Yeah, yeah, he made me change.

13
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,600
So in words, I had a song called So Many Holes.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,039
He made it So Many Proves.

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,439
LAUGHTER

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,280
Well, that certainly toned it down.

17
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,119
LAUGHTER

18
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:34,960
On prose, just prostitutes.

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,879
No, they're professionals.

20
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:38,399
Oh, I see.

21
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,679
LAUGHTER

22
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,960
Silly me.

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
LAUGHTER

24
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,120
The ladies in the video still look quite like hoes.

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,239
LAUGHTER

26
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:47,759
They're professionals.

27
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,359
LAUGHTER

28
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:51,480
They're in a video.

29
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,320
And then, Farell, is it true that he...

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,159
I mean, I'm sure he enjoyed working with you,

31
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,839
but he did have some difficulties working with you as well.

32
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:03,119
Yeah, and when we were working on a particular song

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:05,120
called California Roll,

34
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,959
Stevie Wonder, he came up to the studio,

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,799
and Farell had called a secondhand contact

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,719
from being in the studio with me,

37
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:13,840
and he kind of froze.

38
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
He didn't know how to produce it anymore.

39
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
He was stuck. He was like...

40
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,079
Might have to explain what the...

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:23,920
Yes. So Farell was in an environment

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
created by Snoop.

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,760
LAUGHTER

44
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,560
Farell was no longer the same Farell.

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,760
It's not gonna be so.

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,760
You can't say.

47
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
Yes.

48
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,760
He was... He was now someone else.

49
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,359
LAUGHTER

50
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,840
He was not... He was not the greatest producer in the world.

51
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
He wasn't the greatest producer in the world.

52
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,560
He was just a guy in the room.

53
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,200
LAUGHTER

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,200
So was Stevie Wonder trying to talk to him?

55
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,200
Stevie Wonder was in the mic, both.

56
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,560
And you know, Stevie can't see,

57
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,200
so Stevie was waiting on some direction.

58
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,439
And Farell was giving you no directions

59
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,439
for Stevie was just in there just...

60
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,439
LAUGHTER

61
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
Well, Stevie Farell said,

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
can you sing this part?

63
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
And then Farell said,

64
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,879
can you play the harmonica?

65
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,480
So I had to basically take over,

66
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,120
because Farell was stuck off a space cookie.

67
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,120
He was in another place.

68
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,120
LAUGHTER

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,360
I was Farell happy with his work on that track.

70
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,360
He was happy a couple of days after.

71
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,879
LAUGHTER

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,719
And then you did go to one of those clubs.

73
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:26,319
You went to the ping pong clubs.

74
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,079
We did, yes.

75
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,400
We did in our spare time.

76
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,079
But we also shot stills there.

77
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,240
And I had a very unfortunate experience

78
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,759
with the ping pong ball.

79
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:36,799
What happened?

80
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:39,840
I was trying to be, you know, a show boat.

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,639
Mm-hmm.

82
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:43,039
And I opened up my mouth to pretend to catch the ball.

83
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:44,079
LAUGHTER

84
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,079
And she called my bluff.

85
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:48,079
LAUGHTER

86
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,039
It was amazing.

87
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm totally confused.

88
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
LAUGHTER

89
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,039
OK, so you thought the MTV story...

90
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:57,039
LAUGHTER

91
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:59,039
...was on the screen.

92
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,039
Yeah, off you go, Bradley.

93
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:03,520
You tell us what the nice lady did.

94
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,520
LAUGHTER

95
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,520
LAUGHTER

96
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,520
So you could pay to watch women eject various objects

97
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,199
out of their vaginal cavity.

98
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,400
Is that probably...

99
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
She played a nurse on the arching house with your truck.

100
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,599
That was technical, yeah.

101
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,919
So, like, darts, sex, darts, ping pong balls, sort of kites.

102
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,199
And stuff.

103
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,359
OK, the ribbons to kites.

104
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:32,359
Kites?

105
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,560
Yes, like, ribbons, ribbons in the end of kites.

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,039
If the kites had flown out of there, we'd have...

107
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:39,039
LAUGHTER

108
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:42,159
So in the precision with which you could do it is incredible.

109
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,840
This one, very talented young woman.

110
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,039
And, um...

111
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:47,120
And so we were all sitting there in the monkey,

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,039
chow, myself, and stew.

113
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,560
And I was like...

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
I mean, it was a really good one, Todd.

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Get this one.

116
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Wouldn't it be funny?

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,879
Yeah, it's just like...

118
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,920
BOOM!

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
LAUGHTER

120
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,120
That's your...

121
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,120
It's...

122
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
It's crazy.

123
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,800
And I was zik-a-git.

124
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
LAUGHTER

125
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,599
That's weird.

126
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,360
And, Jenny, you generous creature.

127
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,719
I know you're very busy, but you've already made us a lovely gift.

128
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,840
I did a cake.

129
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,800
And I've got the cake here, before you're just saying it.

130
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,879
This is the cake you made.

131
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,960
I don't know how long you spent making it.

132
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,000
There it is.

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
LAUGHTER

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,199
I've got a cat.

135
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, I don't even ruin night jello, but it looks like shit.

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Taste it. It's delicious.

137
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Come on first.

138
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,199
I'm sad on it.

139
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,400
Well, you're going straight for the shit.

140
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,600
I'm for it.

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,960
Who does it?

142
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,160
I thought I might try that...

143
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,879
Do not cast the first stone straight for the shit.

144
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,480
Look at that.

145
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,000
Ooh.

146
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:47,199
That doesn't work.

147
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,199
LAUGHTER

148
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,199
What a cruel joke we've played on you.

149
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,199
Thank you.

150
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
Self-dried.

151
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,399
I could eat on, but I'll save some room for leisure.

152
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,399
That's right.

153
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,600
Now, that'd be nice if you'd visit us round for Christmas.

154
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,399
Of course.

155
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:09,199
Christmas is coming.

156
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,000
It certainly is.

157
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,800
Are you looking forward to Christmas?

158
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Always.

159
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Really? Are you really into Christmas?

160
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,000
No, I really am into Christmas.

161
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,800
Mm.

162
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,000
Are you into Christmas?

163
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,199
I love it.

164
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,199
LAUGHTER

165
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,400
Seriously, are you?

166
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,199
Yeah.

167
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,600
Last year, Christmas, I spent alone.

168
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,800
Oh.

169
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
LAUGHTER

170
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,400
Come to mind.

171
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
LAUGHTER

172
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,199
Oh, but not jealous.

173
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,000
No, but as a child, you find Christmas quite traumatising.

174
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,600
Did I?

175
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,400
Yes.

176
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,600
Who does?

177
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,199
Won't you win an activity play?

178
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
That was Christian school.

179
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,800
On Christmas, I would steal the baby Jesus'

180
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
and the black wise man.

181
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,400
I tried to create some sort of coup in South Florida

182
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,199
where they would start a ruckus

183
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:56,600
where, and I wrote a letter,

184
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,400
the white man is falsely plasticised,

185
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,800
the white Christmas, and I went on and on,

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,400
and then I replaced the baby Jesus with a ham.

187
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
LAUGHTER

188
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,000
He thought I was arguing with that.

189
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,199
No.

190
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,199
I'm sorry.

192
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,199
Not because I'm knitted in a teen.

193
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,199
There's like...

194
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,199
Nice.

195
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,199
LAUGHTER

196
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,199
And what are you doing for Christmas this year?

197
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,199
Um, not going to my girlfriend's house.

198
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:27,199
Yeah, because you've quite a young girlfriend now, haven't you?

199
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,199
Yes, you do too.

200
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
Girlfriend? Unlikely.

201
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
LAUGHTER

202
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,199
Well, here in Britain, many people will be getting...

203
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,199
I noticed there's an open space in the back of your seat.

204
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,199
Wait.

205
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,199
Yes, the rain.

206
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
Oh, it's...

207
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,199
Yeah, at any moment, Christmas could come.

208
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,199
LAUGHTER

209
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,199
The world living in the world of glamour.

210
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:54,199
You know, it's next in the city, New York, to...

211
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:56,199
David doesn't.

212
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,199
LAUGHTER

213
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,199
Back to where you were in Buzar.

214
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,199
I mean, maybe on paper, it sounds worse than it is.

215
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,199
But is it true you still live in an ex-council flat?

216
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,199
Uh, yes. Yeah.

217
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,199
Well, you must be making quite a lot of money,

218
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:11,199
Gordon has made the houses nice and cheap.

219
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,199
Well, yes, and that's...

220
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
Well, that's neat. I live in a flat I bought six or seven years ago,

221
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,199
is fine, but, except, it's much more unpleasant than it was when I moved in, obviously,

222
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,199
because I've been living there.

223
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,199
LAUGHTER

224
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,199
But I sort of...

225
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,199
The prospect of...

226
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,199
The last time I moved was, I think, the most stressful day of my life ever.

227
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,199
And the prospect of moving in is terrifying.

228
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:34,199
Now, houses are getting cheaper and cheaper.

229
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,199
I've got another excuse not to move.

230
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,199
And I actually... I hate the fact that I have to take pride in where I live.

231
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,199
I... I... I hate... It's all on the television the whole time.

232
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
Everyone's like, oh, I... You know, I couldn't stand this living room.

233
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
I'd have to change that. I'd have to change...

234
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,199
Why do you have to change all these things?

235
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:51,199
All you need is a roof heating, a TV and a fridge.

236
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,199
And you're sorting.

237
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,199
Now, what sort of shit old do you live in?

238
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,199
LAUGHTER

239
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:59,199
It's not that... It's, you know, it's perfectly functioning.

240
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,199
Is it so-or else on the floor?

241
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,199
No, there's carpet on the floor. It's fine.

242
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,199
But the thing is that you... Everyone's got to get such a massive shit

243
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,199
about their domicile.

244
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,199
Why?

245
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:12,199
Because it's a nice thing to surround yourself.

246
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:14,199
But if that's your hobby, fine.

247
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,199
But why is there so much pressure on me to be bothered to move and tidy up

248
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:22,199
and paint the place and worry about that bit over the cooker that's melting?

249
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,199
APPLAUSE

250
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,199
You see, there's a lot of other sluviny people out there.

251
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,200
When we get round to it, we will speak.

252
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,200
You've got to give in the celebrity version about cleaners your house.

253
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,200
I keep an agi, I've got to come round. We've just got to go, oh my god.

254
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Why wouldn't let the...

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,200
I mean, why would I permit that? Why doesn't anyone permit that?

256
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
I mean, why does anyone quit that?

257
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Apart from they do clean your house.

258
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,200
You're curious. I've never felt my house is so dirty

259
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,200
that I wouldn't mind public humiliations.

260
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
I mean, just either do it yourself or pay someone.

261
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,200
You say, no, I want it for free and I don't mind the whole country thinking I'm a slug.

262
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm going to leave you to do a cartwheel, I reckon.

263
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Yeah, I'll leave you to it.

264
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
It's no good, sheerie.

265
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,200
How could I put on six plus seven home?

266
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,200
I'm going to do it with it. You're all in proportion.

267
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
You're not all in proportion.

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
That's why you should know about me.

269
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
I bet you could do it one after a few times.

270
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Definitely.

271
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
Don't keep it in your mind.

272
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
You're staying in Richard Graham, not on what life is.

273
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,200
You said, no, I can't wheel. Why are you doing cartwheel?

274
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
I think the ladies' den have been like...

275
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Oh, my god.

276
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
You've done a lot of work.

277
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
You've done a lot of work.

278
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Why are you pushing your car wheel?

279
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
I've done a lot of work. I've done a lot of work.

280
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I've done a lot of work.

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I've done a lot of work.

282
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Why would I do a cartwheel to pick up a gun?

283
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
I'd just pick up a gun. I wouldn't...

284
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
No. No, no, no.

285
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,200
No, you wouldn't.

286
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
Because they're firing at you, right?

287
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,200
And you can't run.

288
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
Because they're shooting head height. You go, oh, I know.

289
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,200
I'll do a cartwheel that I'm shooting my legs less important than the head.

290
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Right?

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
I'm picking the gun up.

292
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Crumble, because they've shot my legs.

293
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
And then you shoot them.

294
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
Problems straight away.

295
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Go on, I'm mid-cartwheel. They're shooting at me.

296
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
Glasses come on.

297
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,200
I'm a car.

298
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,200
Now I'm shooting at you.

299
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
I have a problem without equal answers on.

300
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
I can't. I don't know what had to do with a car wheel.

301
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
I'll give a thousand pounds to charity if you do a car wheel.

302
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,200
The guys have got to be the charity.

303
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
He could point his neck.

304
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
He could take the numbers.

305
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,200
He could point the check.

306
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,200
I don't think I can get up in the air.

307
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Just go through your head.

308
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,200
They're going to see so much junction tomorrow if you do that cartwheel.

309
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
I died.

310
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
This is a shot shot.

311
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,200
Oh, I'm mad at that.

312
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,200
I'm mad at that.

313
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Why do you need air?

314
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
Because they really, they like the medallady and wheel.

315
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Oh.

316
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
This is going to be brilliant.

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
I should have ironed more than the front of my shirt.

318
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Oh, I'm sweating.

319
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,200
I don't know how to do a car wheel.

320
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,200
You're probably safer to do it behind the sofa.

321
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,200
No, no, no, no.

322
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
We're like, yes.

323
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
We're having the sofa.

324
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Oh, here we go.

325
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Oh.

326
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
How do you do a cartwheel?

327
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
Do you know how to do a car wheel?

328
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
Do you know how to do a car wheel?

329
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
So just pick your arms out for her.

330
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
I think that just makes her careful.

331
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Just, just, just, just do that.

332
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
You get the arms out.

333
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
Just do that.

334
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
No, it's a cartwheel. It's straight ahead.

335
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,200
No, no, no, no. It's sideways, isn't it?

336
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Sideway?

337
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
You've one hand.

338
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
King of Jim.

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Yeah.

340
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,200
How am I going to get my legs up in that far?

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
You kick a middle heart.

342
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I don't know how to hit something.

343
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,200
It's a meant to be bent.

344
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
Yeah.

345
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Why did you put a banana on the floor?

346
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,200
Well, I thought it was just picking up a gun.

347
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I wouldn't run before you could walk.

348
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
You need a bit of momentum.

349
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,200
So you go back there, right?

350
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
And then look, so look, so you're going to run up here, right?

351
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,200
You're going to put your hand there.

352
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
And your legs are going to go up.

353
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
It's going to be amazing.

354
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,200
They're going to go, we're going to slow it down.

355
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I think it's possible.

356
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
You've made me believe.

357
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
It is possible.

358
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
Okay, here we go.

359
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Here we go.

360
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
Okay.

361
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
So, one more.

362
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
This one.

363
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
Oh, excuse me.

364
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Is it that hand on the ground?

365
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
That hand on the ground?

366
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
Yes, that first.

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
That hand on the ground.

368
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm going to kick that leg for all your work.

369
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
Yes, for all your work.

370
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
Okay.

371
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
Oh.

372
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,200
You can.

373
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,200
Okay.

374
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
That was good.

375
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,200
That was excellent.

376
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
I know.

377
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,200
You and Matt Damon, very excited to see you.

378
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I know.

379
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
Lucky me.

380
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Yes.

381
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
It's the two of you.

382
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
He plays a congressman.

383
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
And I play a contemporary bellad answer.

384
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,200
I know.

385
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
I know.

386
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,200
I know.

387
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I know.

388
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
I know.

389
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
You and Matt Damon, very excited to see you.

390
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
I know.

391
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,200
Lucky me.

392
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes.

393
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,200
It's the two of you.

394
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
He plays a...

395
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,200
He plays a congressman.

396
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,200
And I play a contemporary bellad answer.

397
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Do you?

398
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Yes.

399
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
It's Matt's made in heaven.

400
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,200
Yeah.

401
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
You were doing lots of exterior filming.

402
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Oh, yeah.

403
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Which is actually a problem when you're shooting with someone like him

404
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,200
because he's vastly famous and wherever he goes, people are like,

405
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
like, they're brain smelt.

406
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
You know, when you look at someone's face and you realize their brains just melted.

407
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,200
And we were having to do...

408
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
We had this awful day.

409
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,200
We were having to shoot a very emotional scene.

410
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,200
Lots of crying and, you know, begging with each other where we're outside

411
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,200
at a very public place.

412
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,200
And there are about 350 people crowded around watching us do this emotional scene.

413
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,200
That's mortifying.

414
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh, it's really, really hard.

415
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,200
So Matt was just managing to squeeze a tear out when someone from the crowd went,

416
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,200
Matt, look to me, he's not loving it.

417
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,200
This is the worst day of my life.

418
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
This is it.
