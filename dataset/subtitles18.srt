1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
Here are the makeup sponges you asked for.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh thanks, I thought I had more.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Mmm.

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,839
Damn, you've got more makeup than I do.

5
00:00:10,839 --> 00:00:12,359
You've got better makeup than I do.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,560
Yeah, I'm borrowing this.

7
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,759
Hey, hey, hey.

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,480
This is my Comic Con makeup.

9
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,000
I love you, but there are some things a man doesn't share

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
with his girlfriend.

11
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,199
That's a wise policy.

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,240
I once borrowed my sister's makeup for costume contest,

13
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,080
got terrible case of pink guy.

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,079
Yeah, but luckily I was going as a zombie.

15
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:32,079
I went second place.

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,799
I feel like you guys just went to Comic Con.

17
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,079
That was San Diego Comic Con.

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:38,479
This is Baker's Field Comic Con.

19
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,679
Is that better?

20
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a lot smaller.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,320
It's more about the comic books,

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,280
the way these conventions used to be before they went all Hollywood.

23
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,599
So they answered your question?

24
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:48,679
No, it's not better.

25
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,480
Well then why are you going?

26
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,759
It's a comic book convention.

27
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,759
Yeah.

28
00:00:54,759 --> 00:00:56,239
It's like pizza or particle accelerators.

29
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:57,719
And stinky ones still pretty good.

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,679
All right, well you guys have fun.

31
00:01:00,679 --> 00:01:01,719
I guess I'll see you Sunday night.

32
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:02,239
Yeah.

33
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,079
Yeah.

34
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:04,079
Hang on a second.

35
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,079
Hold this.

36
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,079
What was that for?

37
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,280
To show people when they don't believe me.

38
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,280
I know she loves playing the harp.

39
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:22,280
So I found this beautiful music box that plays one of her favorite songs.

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,079
Now Amy already has a real harp.

41
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,079
And they can play any song.

42
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,079
What are you trying to pull here?

43
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,079
No, I just thought it would.

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,079
Next.

45
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,079
Okay.

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,079
I know she's a fan of the Cantiburi Tales.

47
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,079
So I found this cool map that illustrates the characters journey through England.

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,079
I thought we could put it in a really nice frame.

49
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,079
But she's got Google maps on her phone.

50
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
I don't know how to respond to that.

51
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,079
But I hope it's with a third good option because these first two.

52
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,079
Yeah.

53
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,079
Okay.

54
00:02:11,079 --> 00:02:14,079
Well, luckily I saved the best for last.

55
00:02:14,079 --> 00:02:19,079
Since Amy's a neuroscientist, I did some research and found out that Santiago RamÃ³n y Cajal,

56
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:24,079
the father of modern neuroscience, did lots of hand drawings of brain cells.

57
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:30,080
And I managed to find this signed print.

58
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Wow.

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Oh, this is truly remarkable.

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,080
Thank you.

61
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,080
I think I'll keep it for myself.

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,080
What about your girlfriend?

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
This is too late. I called dibs.

64
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,080
Excuse me.

65
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,080
I'm eating a goliwa. It's kind of a first date in a library.

66
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,080
She and I are both a little awkward in social situations.

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
So it seemed like a good idea.

68
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
People say I'm a little awkward too.

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Man, join you?

70
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
No, you can't join us.

71
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
Just go climb back up whatever beanstalk you came down from.

72
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,080
You can do better.

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,080
Oh, we're eating here.

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,080
We're having a texting date.

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,080
I love that.

76
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:59,080
As you're reading, it will help you remember I have it a door of a laxand.

77
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
Anything I can get for you?

78
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,080
It's some apple juice, some gelo.

79
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
No, no, thank you.

80
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,080
But I do have a favorite to ask.

81
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Name it.

82
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,080
Well, I'm booked to do a children's party tomorrow.

83
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,080
And frankly, I don't feel up to it.

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,080
Oh, you're not.

85
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,080
You look awful.

86
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,079
Thank you.

87
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:34,079
Anyway, I mean, you know my act better than anybody.

88
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,079
I was hoping that maybe you know, maybe you'd fill in for me.

89
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:42,079
Are you saying that you want me to be Professor Proton?

90
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,079
Yeah.

91
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,079
Oh, my! What an honor.

92
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:52,079
Oh, this is like being asked to ascend Mount Olympus and dying with the gods.

93
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,079
Or a Korean family in Elambra.

94
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,079
How proud of you, Amy, your first bikini wax.

95
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,079
Yeah.

96
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:12,079
So how you doing?

97
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,079
Oh, little sensitive, but not bad.

98
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,079
You always take that long.

99
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,079
No, they don't usually have to go out and get more wax.

100
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,079
Oh, yeah.

101
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,079
Okay, now pull your car into the spot and let's get out of here.

102
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,079
Wait, I'm leaving my car here?

103
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,079
Yes.

104
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:34,079
And be sure and put on the emergency brake really makes these things tough to budge.

105
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:38,079
Before I park, come in the back seat.

106
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:40,079
I want to show you something I had done today.

107
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,079
All right.

108
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,079
Color me intrigued.

109
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,079
What do you think?

110
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,079
I think you're high on paint fumes.

111
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:56,079
And boy, that's a lot of band-aids.

112
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,079
The first 43 parallel universes I've checked proved to be empty.

113
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:09,079
I see no reason to suspect Universe No. 44 will be any different.

114
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,079
Oh, my God!

115
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,079
Sleep crowd!

116
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:28,079
Oh, you're getting my face!

117
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:30,079
Oh, you're getting my face!

118
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,079
I sheldon.

119
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:41,079
He's in my spot.

120
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,079
You'd later make a stop being naked in my spot.

121
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:47,079
How are you doing?

122
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:50,079
He wasn't using it.

123
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,079
And I needed a nice cool piece of leather to wiggle my naked ass on him.

124
00:06:58,079 --> 00:06:59,079
Get off there.

125
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,079
Give me back my iron man helmet.

126
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,079
Give me back my parking space.

127
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,079
You don't need a parking space. You don't have a car.

128
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,079
But if you don't need an iron man helmet, you're not iron man.

129
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,079
Well, we appear to have reached an impest.

130
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:17,079
And I have to say, I thought you'd be more upset that your laptop is sitting on my junk.

131
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,079
I didn't pick up on that. That's a nice stunt.

132
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,079
You guys need me to call someone. I'm guessing your mom's.

133
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,079
Thanks, but we've got to cover.

134
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,079
Okay, I just talked to my mom.

135
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,079
She arranged for a scatter rental car.

136
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,079
Great. We can send me a gift to Comic-Con.

137
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,079
Are you kidding me?

138
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,079
You're always been through. I just want to go home.

139
00:07:47,079 --> 00:07:49,079
Don't be like that. Come on. How are you talking to him?

140
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,079
I'm with Leonard. I'm done.

141
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:54,079
Fine.

142
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,079
And I guess it's two against two. How do we decide?

143
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,079
Actually, it's three against one.

144
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:03,079
What? Well, what about the mission?

145
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,079
You said we were real life landing party.

146
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,079
Well, we're not.

147
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,079
We're an imaginary landing party.

148
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,079
We have real life garbage thrown at us.

149
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,079
By real life strangers, you think we're idiots.

150
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,079
I'll tell you the truth. I'm sorry. I'm to feel like one.

151
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:20,079
I want to go home now.

152
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:23,079
Okay.

153
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,079
Did we at least rent the car from Enterprise?

154
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,079
Get it? Enterprise.

155
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,079
Screw you. That's funny.

156
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,079
Whatever you got me, you can return.

157
00:08:41,079 --> 00:08:42,079
No.

158
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:46,079
No. After everything you didn't do for me tonight, I want you to have it.

159
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,080
What's this? Read it.

160
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,080
Sheldon Cooper, Caltech University employee information.

161
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
At the bottom.

162
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,080
In case of emergency, please contact Amy Farrah Fowler.

163
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,080
And there's my phone number.

164
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,080
This is the most beautiful gift you could have ever given me.

165
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,080
Well, I thought if I have a stroke or a kidney stone,

166
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,080
who would I want to share that with?

167
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
And you picked me.

168
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
It's like you said, you're my girlfriend.

169
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,080
Oh, Sheldon.

170
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
Okay.

171
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,080
Stop ruining Valentine's Day and order my pizza.

172
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I can't believe I ditched work for Disneyland.

173
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
What did you tell your boss?

174
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,080
Oh, I was very clever. I did it in stages.

175
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,080
At seven last night, I called about a problem at the lab

176
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
and casually mentioned I was going out for seafood.

177
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,080
At 9.30, I called and told him that one of my scallops tasted weird.

178
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,080
At 11.30, I called and said I was throwing up like a fire hose.

179
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,080
At 12.45, I called and made nothing but dry heaving sounds.

180
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,080
And now I'm going to Disneyland.

181
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Penny, what did you say?

182
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:17,080
I work at the Cheesecake Factory. I said bye.

183
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,080
So what are we going to do first?

184
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,080
I don't know about you guys, but I'm going to make a beeline for the place

185
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,080
that gives you a princess makeover.

186
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,080
Oh, that sounds like fun.

187
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,080
You're kidding, right? We're not just going to get drunk and go on rides.

188
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
Come on, do it with us.

189
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,080
All right, whatever. How does it work?

190
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,080
Okay, so you pick your princess, sleeping beauties, no whites, Cinderella.

191
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,080
They give you hair, make up the works.

192
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Guess it would be fun to be Cinderella.

193
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Oh, I want to be Cinderella too.

194
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
Yeah. We can't all be Cinderella.

195
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,080
Then how do we decide?

196
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Well, it's simple. This was my idea. I'm driving. I'm Cinderella.

197
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
You bitches got a problem with that. We could stop the car right now.

198
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,080
It's really you.

199
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:15,080
Mr. Jeffers, I am so sorry. We should have told you about the broken elevator.

200
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
I agree.

201
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,080
Professor Proton, it's an honor to meet you.

202
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Just call me Arthur.

203
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,080
Leonard.

204
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,080
Did you hear that?

205
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Professor Proton said I should call him Arthur. That means we're friends.

206
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,080
No, a friend would have told me about the elevator.

207
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Look at me.

208
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,080
I can get as close to you as I want without my mom saying it's going to ruin my eyes.

209
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,080
Is he dangerous?

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Actually, he's a genius.

211
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,080
I am.

212
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
That doesn't answer my question.

213
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,080
Mr. Jeffers, I'm Leonard. This is my girlfriend Penny.

214
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,080
Hi.

215
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,080
Hello.

216
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Well, I hope I haven't kept the kids waiting too long for the show.

217
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,080
Oh, no, there are no kids.

218
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,080
No, the show's for me.

219
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,080
Come on, Aracia.

220
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,080
Arthur.

221
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Is the blonde girl really your girlfriend?

222
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,080
Yes, sir.

223
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
You're the genius.

224
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,080
You find yourselves in an overgrown old forest.

225
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Before you is a giant oak tree with a face on it.

226
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,080
That looks a lot like Nicholas Cage.

227
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,080
He says, travel with caution.

228
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:09,080
These woods are home to the bones of many of all and hero.

229
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,080
I want to see how it's just as good a dungeon master as I am.

230
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,080
As good. You just got pounced in the school yard for eyes.

231
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
Come on, guys. Focus.

232
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,080
Oh, my dear Nicholas Cage tree.

233
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,080
We thank you for your warning, but we are brave warriors and nothing short of death will keep us from our goal.

234
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Oh, Lucifer, after all. See ya.

235
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave. We just started.

236
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,080
You're right. I should finish the game.

237
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
I take my plus one long sword stab myself on the face with it. I'm dead. I've got to date with the girl. Bye!

238
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,080
You'll be fine. Watch.

239
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Suddenly, a spectral shape rises from Kuthrupali's bloody corpse and says, don't worry, buddies.

240
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,080
Ghost Raj will help guide you through the forest.

241
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Well, I'm just a tree, but if I were you, I'd listen to your goves, friend.

242
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,080
Would you like to hear a classic Sheldon Cooper factoid?

243
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
What do you think? Great.

244
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,080
I've been doing some reading about vehicular safety.

245
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:33,080
Did you know that the highest number of drowning accidents happen on or around boats?

246
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,080
Interesting that you would bring that up when I might go work on a boat.

247
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,080
That's the thing about that, Lloyds. They're interesting.

248
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
I know what you're doing.

249
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,080
You don't want me going on this research trip because you're afraid to be alone.

250
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,080
Well, I'm not afraid to be alone on land.

251
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm the sea. It would be terrifying.

252
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,080
Because of all the drowning.

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,080
So, babe.

254
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Now, fine. No more drowning talk. I'll change the subject.

255
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,080
Who do you think would win in a fight?

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,080
You or a shark.

257
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Look, I appreciate your signature blend of concern for me and incredible selfishness.

258
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:26,080
If I get the chance to do this, there's nothing you can say that's going to stop me.

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Very well.

260
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Things between you and Penny have never been better.

261
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,080
I hope four months apart doesn't change anything.

262
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,080
I should have opened with that, huh?

263
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,080
I haven't Stephen Hawking played a word.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,080
The guy's a genius. Maybe you weren't challenging enough for him.

265
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,080
Not challenging. I was humiliating the man.

266
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,080
I was thinking of writing a book called The Brief History of the Time I Made Stephen Hawking,

267
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Cry Like A Little Girl.

268
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,080
Here's the problem.

269
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,080
You can't beat Hawking like that. He hates to lose.

270
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,080
Everyone knows the guy's a big baby.

271
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,080
Forget the wheelchair. He should be in a stroller.

272
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,080
Really?

273
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,080
One time when I was working with him, he said that Johnny Depp was in the Matrix.

274
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:23,080
I told him he was wrong, but he kept insisting.

275
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,080
So I looked it up online and showed him.

276
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Well, the next day, he had a pizza party, and everyone got invited. But me.

277
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Then he was all, you're a rehabilitation.

278
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,080
Instead of got out in law, I was doing the Matrix.

279
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
Good Lord.

280
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,080
What have I done?

281
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Good Lord. What have I done?

282
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
Terrible.

283
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,080
Alright, hot shot. Let's hear your Indian.

284
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:01,080
I can't sit on that elephant. My ass is on fire from eating or it is curry.

285
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,079
Okay, yeah, that's pretty good.

286
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,079
Why are these staring?

287
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,079
Who cares? Just soak it in.

288
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,079
Hello boys.

289
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,079
Oh, hey.

290
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,079
Can you please stop staring? They're just girls. It's nothing you haven't seen in movies or in drawings.

291
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,079
Hey Stewart.

292
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,079
What brings you guys here?

293
00:17:43,079 --> 00:17:45,079
We're looking for a recommendation about comic books.

294
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:47,079
Oh, well, I recommend you don't open a store and sell them.

295
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,079
No, we're just wondering why the guys like this stuff so much, so we thought we'd give it a try.

296
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,079
Oh, okay. What do you think you might be into?

297
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:59,079
Superhero, fantasy, graphic novels, manga, I swear I will turn a hose on you.

298
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,079
What kind of comics do the guys like?

299
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,079
A little bit of everything. Mostly superhero stuff.

300
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,079
Alright, well who's the best superhero?

301
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,079
I can't ask a question like that in here. You trying to start a rumble?

302
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:21,079
Bernie, home.

303
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,079
You have fun today?

304
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,079
Yes, and I have a surprise for you.

305
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,079
Please be center, hello, please be center, hello.

306
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:34,079
Well hello, Prince Charming.

307
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:40,079
Well lady.

308
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,079
Hey, how was it? What?

309
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,079
I can explain, I played hooky with the girls and we all went to Disneyland and got...

310
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:04,079
What are you doing? Just ignore it. Go on and listen.

311
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:14,079
Sheldon, all snow white needs is one little kiss to wake up.

312
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,079
Hergy the first time.

313
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:22,079
We're all here tonight because we have no one to be with.

314
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,079
But it doesn't make us mutants.

315
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,079
The only mutants here are in these comic books.

316
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:39,079
You gotta stop defining ourselves worth by whether or not we're in a relationship.

317
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,079
You know I see you in El Corral?

318
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,079
I see you're room full of great people.

319
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,079
Don't I give ourselves a break? We are a community.

320
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,079
And as long as we have each other, we're never truly alone.

321
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,079
That was cool, what you said.

322
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,079
You really think so?

323
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:11,079
Yeah, I do.

324
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,079
Thank you.

325
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,079
Do you like to get a cup of coffee?

326
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,079
Okay.

327
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,079
Later losers!

328
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:39,079
Let me say if I have this straight, you two are our physicists.

329
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,079
And you and you want me to do a children's science show.

330
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,079
Yes.

331
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,079
And if there's time, take 12 pictures with us in seasonal clothing.

332
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:03,079
You know I'm a real scientist.

333
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,079
I have a PhD from Cornell University.

334
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:08,079
Yeah, it's great.

335
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,079
Did you bring your puppet?

336
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:12,079
No, no.

337
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,079
I hate that puppet.

338
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,079
Oh.

339
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:24,079
No, how could anybody hate G-no the neutrino?

340
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:27,079
It's nice, huh?

341
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,079
I got him for 20 bucks on eBay.

342
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,079
Including his shipping!

343
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:36,079
I'm awake, right?

344
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
This is happening.

345
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,079
Here we are.

346
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:48,079
Really gonna miss you.

347
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,079
Gonna miss you too.

348
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:52,079
Penny, we're in the red zone.

349
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:56,079
The white zone is for loading and unloading.

350
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,079
We're breaking the law.

351
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,079
There's no space in the white zone, so.

352
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:06,079
Anyway, we can email and I think the phone connections are pretty good.

353
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,079
All right, you have to get out of the car right now. I'm not going to jail for you.

354
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,079
You just relax.

355
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,079
Oh, I see a space in the white zone.

356
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:13,079
Quick, circle the airport.

357
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:15,079
Did you bring enough inhalers?

358
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,079
Yeah.

359
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:17,079
And extra dramelline?

360
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:20,079
You remember what happened on its small world?

361
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,079
No, I'm covered.

362
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:24,079
Okay.

363
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,079
Oh dear lord, a police officer is clancing in our direction.

364
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,079
We've been made.

365
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,079
Calm down, I'm getting out.

366
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,079
Something I want to give you.

367
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,079
I'm a winner.

368
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,079
All right, it's just a heart shape lock with a picture of Leonard's face and he got them all on clearance.

369
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,079
Now move, move, move!

370
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,079
I love you.

371
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:47,079
I love you too.

372
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,079
Don't worry officer, they just love each other.

373
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,079
We're not smuggling drugs.

374
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:03,079
This cushion experienced a nude revenge wiggle.

375
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,079
A wet, a naked man set on it.

376
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,079
Now here's my concern.

377
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,079
His diet is rich and fatty deli means.

378
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,079
What tests do you have to detect lipid residue?

379
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
Lipid, what?

380
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:24,079
Lipid residue.

381
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,079
An anal autograph.

382
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:30,079
A colon calling card if you win.

383
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,079
Tuesday okay.

384
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:41,079
Now don't rush it, we may be dealing with befalma, don't at molecular level.

385
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:43,079
Let me write you a tip.

386
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:46,079
Did you never play dungeons and dragons with girls before?

387
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,079
Oh don't worry sweetie, no one has.

388
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,079
What do you say?

389
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,079
I'll leave it up to the dungeon master.

390
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:05,079
Satanic fungus that looks suspiciously like alpichino.

391
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,079
Rises from the forest floor and says,

392
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,079
You're playing D&D.

393
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,079
You're playing D&D.

394
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,079
This whole apartment.

395
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,079
It's playing D&D.

396
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,079
What are you doing in our dungeon?

397
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:31,079
You shall die.

398
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:35,079
Literal goosebumps look.

399
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:38,079
What do you do?

400
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,079
I draw my broadsword.

401
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,079
I read my quarter staff.

402
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,079
I drink my potion.

403
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,079
I see we attack the big one.

404
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,079
You know what, give me the dice I want to roll.

405
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:50,079
The dungeon master's festival.

406
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:54,079
Yeah well I'm supposed to be in Vegas throwing up on a shrimp buffet, I'll give it.

407
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:57,079
Alright what do I need?

408
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,079
15 or higher.

409
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:02,079
15 is the point, the point is 15.

410
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,079
Give the little lady some room here it is coming out.

411
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:07,079
16!

412
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:12,079
Please tell me we're playing for money.

413
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,079
No even better than money you gained experience points.

414
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:19,079
More potion please.

415
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:21,079
Hey you don't need Leonard in his app.

416
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:22,079
You can make one with me.

417
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:24,079
With you?

418
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,079
Seriously I have a great idea for what?

419
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,079
Was it better than your idea to move to Los Angeles and become a famous actress?

420
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:41,079
Okay look when you see some of wearing shoes you like you just snap a picture of them and the app goes on the internet to find out where you can buy them.

421
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,079
That's your app idea.

422
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:45,079
You don't like it?

423
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,079
I didn't say that but no I don't.

424
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,079
Okay these are hugs.

425
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,079
These are crocs.

426
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:00,079
These are knock off monologlonex.

427
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,079
Board.

428
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,079
Look you said it yourself we have to create a database before you can write an algorithm thingy.

429
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:07,079
Algorithm.

430
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,079
You see Penny Allen touring defines an algorithm.

431
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,079
Board.

432
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,079
Okay these are Steve Madden's.

433
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,079
These are Nine West.

434
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,079
These are Target.

435
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,079
Oh but don't they look like Chanel.

436
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,079
These are my-

437
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,079
Oh but it knows.

438
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:24,079
It's a boxy.

439
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:26,079
These are such shells.

440
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:32,079
I'm making the donation to your department regardless of what happens between us.

441
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:34,079
Really?

442
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,079
Of course there's no quint pro quo here.

443
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,079
You and your colleagues are doing remarkable research and you deserve the money.

444
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:42,079
Oh.

445
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:44,079
Then what was last night about?

446
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,079
I took a shot.

447
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,079
So many.

448
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,079
Oh.

449
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,079
You're a very handsome man Leonard.

450
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,079
Thank you.

451
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,079
It was foolish of me to think someone your age might ever be interested in someone like me.

452
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,079
Oh don't say that. You're a very attractive woman.

453
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:05,079
Oh please.

454
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:06,079
No it's true.

455
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:07,079
Well aren't you sweet.

456
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:09,079
Just for the record?

457
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,079
You'd remember a light with me for the rest of your life.

458
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,079
I'm sure I would.

459
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:20,079
But why why exactly?

460
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:23,079
You're a very smart man.

461
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:26,079
How do you think I laughed is that you're rich husband?

462
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,079
I hadn't really given him much thought.

463
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,079
Well think about it.

464
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:35,079
You mean...

465
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,079
Yep.

466
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:37,079
I'm that good.

467
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,079
But what the hell?

468
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:47,079
You used what I wonder about zombies?

469
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:48,079
Oh.

470
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:52,079
What happened to the con get any human flesh to eat?

471
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,079
The con stuffed to death they already dead.

472
00:27:55,079 --> 00:28:01,079
You take this one I spent an hour last night on how do vampires shave when they can't see themselves in the mirror?

473
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,079
Well groomed vampires meet in pairs and shave each other case closed.

474
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:10,079
Yeah okay so zombies.

475
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,079
I guess it depends on the zombies.

476
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:17,079
Roger we talking slow zombies fast zombies like in 28 days if those zombies didn't eat they star.

477
00:28:17,079 --> 00:28:23,079
Yeah you're thinking of 28 days later 28 days is where Sandra Bullock goes to rehab and puts the audience into an undead state.

478
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,079
Hey don't back on Sandra Bullock.

479
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,079
You think it makes you look cultured but you just come off as Bitto.

480
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,079
Nice shot.

481
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,079
Thank you.

482
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:36,079
My father taught me archery as a child.

483
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,079
It's odd how the activity brings back the smell of Kmart bourbon.

484
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,079
Perfect.

485
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,079
I know.

486
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:52,079
What an elf I would have made.

487
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:57,079
What do you think you're doing?

488
00:28:57,079 --> 00:28:58,079
Shooting at a target?

489
00:28:58,079 --> 00:28:59,079
With what?

490
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,079
An arrow.

491
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,079
Really?

492
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,079
I didn't see you draw one from your quiver.

493
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,079
I'm not gonna do that, Sheldon.

494
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:13,079
Get Leonard the people at Nintendo can only go so far in helping us recreate an actual athletic experience.

495
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,079
We have to do our part too.

496
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:26,079
I was uncalled for but I'll play along.

497
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:27,079
Ow.

498
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:34,079
I got something I want to ask Bernadette and I can't think of a better time than when I'm with all my friends.

499
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,079
Oh hold on Howard there's lots of better times.

500
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:43,079
Leonard please the man is talking let him get it out and let the chips fall where they may.

501
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,079
Thank you.

502
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:51,079
Bernadette, Marianne, Rust and Kowski.

503
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:53,079
Oh God what's happening?

504
00:29:54,079 --> 00:30:02,079
I know things haven't been perfect with us and we've had our problems but I just have to tell you from the moment I read.

505
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,079
Let me just stop you right here.

506
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:05,079
This is it.

507
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:08,079
Yes.

508
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,079
Yes what?

509
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,079
Yes I will marry you.

510
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:15,079
You will? You will?

511
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,079
I will.

512
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:19,079
I will.

513
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,079
I love you so much.

514
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,079
I love you too.

515
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,079
Congratulations.

516
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:25,079
I'm so excited.

517
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:29,079
Tonight is pizza night.

518
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:31,079
I'd like to refer that to my attorney.

519
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:37,079
According to what I see here, those are Frank Coney's pizza night.

520
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:42,079
Yes and when Frank Coney's went out of business we switched to Graziano's.

521
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:46,079
It's interesting can you just switch restaurants like that, Priya?

522
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:53,079
The question Howard, turns out you can't.

523
00:30:53,079 --> 00:31:00,079
According to the document you drew up, Sheldon, the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60 day comment period.

524
00:31:01,079 --> 00:31:03,079
Were those criteria met?

525
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,079
No.

526
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,079
Oh God!

527
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,079
This is Greek food Leonard you hate Greek food.

528
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:22,079
Not as much as you.

529
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,079
No!

530
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:40,079
Shake it man shake it!

531
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,079
Boy, tell the undying shoulders.

532
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,079
You out to dance?

533
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,079
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,079
I'm in game.

535
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,079
How about you?

536
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,079
Oh what the hell?

537
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:12,079
Leonard are you in the shower?

538
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,079
I can't hear you I'm in the shower!

539
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:18,079
I asked if you were in the shower but that's moved now.

540
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,079
I'm moved rendered unimportant by reason to dance.

541
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,079
I can't hear you I'm in the shower!

542
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,079
I have to skip the chit chat.

543
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,079
Emergency.

544
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:33,079
What kind of emergency?

545
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,079
Mathematical, 32-ounce banana smoothie, 16-ounce bladder.

546
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,079
You might not want to do that.

547
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,079
Well I sure you I do.

548
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:44,079
I'm not alone in here.

549
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:45,079
Go what?

550
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,079
I look sheldon.

551
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:50,079
What are you doing in there?

552
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:51,079
We she can't be in here.

553
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,079
We're in here first.

554
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,079
You can't be in here.

555
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:57,079
According to the roommate agreement paragraph 9 subsection B,

556
00:32:57,079 --> 00:33:01,079
the right bathroom privacy is suspended in the event of force measure.

557
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,079
And believe me, I'm experiencing a very measure force.

558
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,079
Come on you can't wait two minutes.

559
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:11,079
Leonard let the men be.

560
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,079
Penny.

561
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,079
Penny.

562
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,079
Penny.

563
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:23,079
What?

564
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,079
Move, move, move.

565
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:27,079
Good news.

566
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:30,079
I finally have a handle on my idea for three person chess.

567
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:33,079
That is a good news, bye.

568
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,079
Do you know how I solved the balance center combat area problem?

569
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
Five words.

570
00:33:39,079 --> 00:33:43,079
Transitional quadrilateral to triangular testellation.

571
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:47,079
That's brilliant.

572
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,079
It's what I do.

573
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,079
But wait, there's more.

574
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,079
I also invented two new chess pieces.

575
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,079
The serpent and the old woman.

576
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,079
Okay now I have to ask what do they do?

577
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,079
With the serpent slithers to an opposing player's piece,

578
00:34:05,079 --> 00:34:09,079
that piece is considered poisoned and will die after two more moves.

579
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,079
All right.

580
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
But unless it gets to the old woman in time,

581
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,079
in which case she sucks out the poison,

582
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,079
turning her into the grand impress.

583
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,079
A piece combining the power of the night, queen and serpent.

584
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,079
Alligant.

585
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,079
That's because it's simple.

586
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:38,079
Preage has made a snide comment about your acting career.

587
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,079
What the hell did she say?

588
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,079
She thinks it's cool you're following your dream no matter what.

589
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,079
That bitch!

590
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,079
How do you want to handle it?

591
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:51,079
Um, okay.

592
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,079
Tell Bernadette to tell Priya that I'm on my way to Prague

593
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,079
to shoot a movie with Angelina Jolie.

594
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:58,079
Got it.

595
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,079
Is it going to be in 3D?

596
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,079
What? I don't know. It doesn't matter.

597
00:35:03,079 --> 00:35:04,079
I'm going to say 3D.

598
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,079
That'll let her know the studio has faith in it.

599
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,079
You're kidding, 3D?

600
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,079
That's what I hear.

601
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,079
Well, studio must have real faith in it.

602
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:22,079
Why shouldn't tell me?

603
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,079
Have you been spending time with your ex-girlfriend?

604
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:26,079
No.

605
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,079
Then why you surprise she didn't tell you?

606
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:34,079
Well, it's not as much a surprise as you are.

607
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,079
You know, the other thing.

608
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,079
What other thing?

609
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
If you...

610
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:46,079
I don't...

611
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,079
What's the word I'm looking for?

612
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,079
I'm not going to help you. This is hilarious.

613
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,079
Let's see if this drug works.

614
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,079
Forgive me for staring, but you're very beautiful.

615
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,079
Thank you.

616
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,079
That's a great accent. Where are you from?

617
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,079
India.

618
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:17,079
Oh, cool I've always wanted to go there.

619
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,079
It's a beautiful country. You'd love it.

620
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:20,079
May I join you?

621
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,079
Uh, okay.

622
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,079
Sure, why not?

623
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:27,079
My name is Dr. Rajesh Kutrupali and this is my friend, Dr. Sheldon Kupur.

624
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:28,079
Hi.

625
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,079
Oh, there's no need to interact with me. I'm just here to observe.

626
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:34,079
What's he observing?

627
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,079
We're scientists. We observe everything.

628
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,079
Here, go buy yourself a scone.

629
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,079
All right.

630
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,079
I'd like to buy a scone.

631
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,079
Oh, I'm sorry we're out. We have muffins.

632
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:49,079
They sound delicious, but this money is earmarked for scones.

633
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,079
What are you doing?

634
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,079
Well, just getting comfortable.

635
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
So, I don't let you live in Los Angeles.

636
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,079
I... they were out of scones.

637
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,079
Oh, Sheldon, I'm talking to someone. You're being rude.

638
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,079
I bet you're an actress.

639
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,079
If not, you should be. You have a very expressive face.

640
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:10,079
Oh, my God.

641
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,079
Wait, where are you going? We're doing so well.

642
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:15,079
She never even got to see my penis.

643
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:27,079
I must say, Penny, this is great fun.

644
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,079
Glad you're enjoying yourself.

645
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:34,079
Until I met you in Bernadette, my trips to the bathroom have been entirely focused on elimination.

646
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:37,079
Now they have a delightful social aspect.

647
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,079
You must have been in the bathroom with other women before.

648
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:49,079
Of course I have, but they were strangers and seemed off put when I engaged in friendly stall to stall chit chat.

649
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,079
Some women don't like to get chummy when their panties are down.

650
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,079
You okay in there, Bestie?

651
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,079
From fine.

652
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,079
The reason I ask is that many people experience bladder shyness.

653
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:03,079
The inability to pass you.

654
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,079
Yes, and I'm fine. Stop talking to me.

655
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,079
She always does crabby when she urinates.

656
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:10,079
We really not that close.

657
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,079
Screw it, I'll go later.

658
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:15,079
And I'll be right by your side.

659
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:18,079
Do you like her? She's great, huh?

660
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,079
She's a lovely girl. Who does a button?

661
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:25,079
That's good to hear, because I've got some news.

662
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,079
I hope it's good news, because I've got nothing but disappointment in here.

663
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,079
Bernadette and I are getting married.

664
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,079
Ma.

665
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,079
You too busy bearing down.

666
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:54,079
Ma.

667
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,079
Oh my gosh, Ma.

668
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:01,079
Stand back, I'm gonna break the door down.

669
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:07,079
Stop it.

670
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:11,079
It's time for bitch.

671
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,079
Help!

672
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:14,079
Finally.

673
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:31,079
Oh what, fresh hell is this?

674
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,079
Wait, you can't leave here, you've been exposed!

675
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,079
No, I haven't.

676
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,079
It's all good.

677
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:49,079
Mountain elf.

678
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:55,079
He takes the elf from off the shelf.

679
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:57,079
How handsome.

680
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:01,079
How handsome!

681
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,079
Colossal certain.

682
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,079
My god, a colossal serpent right here.

683
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,079
Must you!

684
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,079
Sorry, I'm just trying to cheer my buddy up.

685
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:20,079
Rotting zombie.

686
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:23,079
Sheldon's new Facebook photo.

687
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,079
Sandor Wizard of the North?

688
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:29,079
Ha, I win.

689
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:32,079
She skipped the part of upping under a two week quarantine

690
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,079
because you were exposed to a deadly disease.

691
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,079
Absolutely.

692
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:39,079
That's my water.

693
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:40,079
What?

694
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,079
My water, you're drinking it.

695
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:43,079
Beer, lord.

696
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:46,079
Have you been drinking it?

697
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,079
Yes, it's my water.

698
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,079
Well, that's it then.

699
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:51,079
I'm dead.

700
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,079
Here we go.

701
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,079
What, I'm sorry?

702
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,079
Do I really need to connect the dots for you

703
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,079
with the backwash into this glass?

704
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:02,079
Is every pathogen that calls your mouth home sweet home?

705
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,079
Not to mention the visitors who arrive on the dancing tongue

706
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:07,079
of your subtropical girlfriend.

707
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,079
Hey, that's my sister and my gun to you talking about.

708
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:14,079
Then it may have defiled one, but I won't have you talking smack

709
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,079
about the other.

710
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,079
You guys ready to order?

711
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,079
Yes, I'd like a seven day course of penicillin,

712
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,079
some syrup of Ipacaque to induce vomiting and amint.

713
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:27,079
I don't understand.

714
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:28,079
He drank from Leonard's glass.

715
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,079
He drank from Leonard's glass.

716
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:31,079
Words will be carving into my tombstone.

717
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:35,079
That's actually my napkin.

718
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:36,079
Oh, this is a nightmare.

719
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,079
Where are you going?

720
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,079
To the bar to sterilize my mouth with alcohol.

721
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:43,079
Game by, dead man walking.

722
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,079
To friendship.

723
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:48,079
Would you booze, hound, please stop that inferno, blink back.

724
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,079
And the answer with elephant.

725
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,079
Oh God.

726
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,079
Oh God.

727
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,079
Okay, look, this never happened.

728
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:38,079
Do you understand me?

729
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:43,079
Really? Still can't talk to me?

730
00:42:45,079 --> 00:42:46,079
Do you go on many dates?

731
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,079
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't say money.

732
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:49,079
A few.

733
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:54,079
What's...

734
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,079
Your characterization of approximately 171 different men is a few.

735
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,079
Where did you get 171 men?

736
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:06,079
Simple extrapolation.

737
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:09,079
In the three years that I've known you, you were single for two.

738
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,079
During that time, I saw 17 different suitors.

739
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,079
If we work backwards, correcting for observation bias

740
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:18,079
and postulate an initial dating age of 15.

741
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,079
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

742
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:22,079
I did not start dating at 15.

743
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:23,079
I'm sorry, 16.

744
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:24,079
14.

745
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,079
My mistake.

746
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:30,079
Now, assuming the left side of a bell curve peaking around the present,

747
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,079
that would bring the total up to 193 men.

748
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:37,079
Plus or minus 8 men.

749
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:40,079
Remarkable.

750
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:42,079
Did you have sexual intercourse with all of these men?

751
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,079
No.

752
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,079
Although that number would be fairly easy to calculate,

753
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,079
based on the number of awkward encounters I've had

754
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,079
with strange men leaving her apartment in the morning.

755
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:53,079
Plus, the number of times she's returned home,

756
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:55,079
wearing the same clothes she wore the night before.

757
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,079
Okay, Sheldon, I think you've made your point.

758
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:02,079
So we multiply 193, it minus 21 men before the loss of virginity.

759
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,079
So 172 times 0.18 gives us 30.96 sexual partners.

760
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,079
Let's round that up to 31.

761
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,079
Okay, Sheldon, you are so wrong.

762
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:18,079
That is not even close to the real number.

763
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,079
I'm gonna need a drink over here.

764
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:21,079
What about your predominant?

765
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:22,079
Don't have one.

766
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:24,079
You have telematics in your shoes connected to an iPod?

767
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,079
No.

768
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,079
What do you do?

769
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,079
You just go out there and gamble about like a bunny?

770
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,079
No, I just run till I'm hungry and then I stop for a bare clock.

771
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,079
Why are you doing that?

772
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:41,079
It's good to stretch your muscles before you run.

773
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,079
All right.

774
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,079
All right.

775
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,079
All right, let's start with a toe touch.

776
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,079
Okay, you do it.

777
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,079
I am doing it.

778
00:44:57,079 --> 00:44:59,079
Oh, wow, good job.

779
00:44:59,079 --> 00:45:01,079
Okay, um, can you do this?

780
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:05,079
We'll never know.

781
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,079
Okay, let's just warm up on the run.

782
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,079
Okay, let's go.

783
00:45:09,079 --> 00:45:12,079
Yeah, I've been reading up on biomechanics.

784
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,079
I think you'll be surprised.

785
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:14,079
Am I?

786
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,079
Oh!

787
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,079
Oh my god, are you okay?

788
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,079
I think so.

789
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:20,079
Hey, where may help you up?

790
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:21,079
Thank you.

791
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,079
Oh, Sheldon!

792
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,079
If it makes you feel any better, Thursday is no longer cruciferous vegetable life.

793
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,079
Together in this car with my enhanced capabilities, we're like Knight Rider.

794
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:41,079
Except a Knight Rider, the car isn't a Yammering Sphinxer.

795
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:50,079
You mock the Sphinxer, but the Sphinxer is a class of muscle without which human beings couldn't survive.

796
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:57,079
There are over 50 different Sphinxers in the human body.

797
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:59,079
How many can you name?

798
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:01,079
I was wrong.

799
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:03,079
This is exactly like Knight Rider.

800
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:06,079
Perhaps you'd be interested in a different game.

801
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:13,079
No, this is a photograph of the 1911 SoulVay conference on the theory of radiation in Quanta.

802
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,079
Using Photoshop, I've introduced a few anachronisms.

803
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,079
See if you can spot all 24.

804
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,079
I'll give you the first one.

805
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,079
Madame Curie should not be wearing a digital watch.

806
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,079
And go.

807
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,079
That's it, bye-bye.

808
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,079
Bazinga!

809
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,079
I have an override switch.

810
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,079
I almost died.

811
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,079
And I'm safe and sound in bed.

812
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:46,079
Who's crazy now?

813
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,079
I'm still gonna go with you.

814
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,079
I'm sure she's the best fit for our little...

815
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:56,079
That's what we call it, Rebel Alliance.

816
00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:00,079
Oh, I've never identified with the Rebel Alliance.

817
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:05,079
Despite their tendency to build death stars, I've always been more of an empire man.

818
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:08,079
Yeah, not my point.

819
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:09,079
I know what your point is.

820
00:47:09,079 --> 00:47:11,079
You're intimidated by Amy's intellect.

821
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,079
To that, I say, fuck up.

822
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,079
Okay, let me just get right to it.

823
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:21,079
Amy is judgmental, sanctimonious, and frankly, just obnoxious.

824
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:24,079
So?

825
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:27,079
So we already have you for all that.

826
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:31,079
Are you suggesting I terminate my relationship with Amy?

827
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:32,079
No, no, of course not.

828
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,079
Just have your relationship someplace else.

829
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,079
It's called counterfactuals.

830
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,079
We postulate an alternate world that differs from ours in one key aspect,

831
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:43,079
and then pose questions to each other.

832
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:45,079
It's fun for ages 8 to 80. Join us.

833
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:49,079
All right, I like a good brain teaser.

834
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:50,079
Give it a whirl.

835
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,079
You're in luck. This is an easy one.

836
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,079
In a world where mankind is ruled by a giant intelligent beaver,

837
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,079
what food is no longer consumed?

838
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:05,079
A BLT where the B stands for beaver.

839
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,079
Leonard B. Sirius, we're playing a game here.

840
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:13,079
I can figure this out. Let's see.

841
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,079
Well, beavers eat tree bark.

842
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,079
The only tree bark I know that humans consume is cinnamon.

843
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,079
So I'll say cinnamon.

844
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,079
Incorrect. Obviously the answer is cheese Danish.

845
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,079
What?

846
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,079
In a world ruled by a giant beaver, mankind builds many dams

847
00:48:31,079 --> 00:48:33,079
to please the beaver overlord.

848
00:48:33,079 --> 00:48:35,079
The low-lying city of Copenhagen is flooded.

849
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,079
Thousands die, devastated the Danes never invent their namesake pastry.

850
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,079
How does one miss that?

851
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:48,079
Man.

852
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,079
Surprise.

853
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,079
Man, what an unexpected pleasure.

854
00:48:57,079 --> 00:49:00,079
Man, that's a powerful smell.

855
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:07,079
I'd like you to meet Oppenheimer, Frisch, Penowsky, Feynman, Wieskopf.

856
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:11,079
Yeah, I get it. You got a lot of cats and you gave them cute Jewish names.

857
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,079
Cats make wonderful companions.

858
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,079
They don't argue or question my intellectual authority.

859
00:49:19,079 --> 00:49:24,079
And this little guy here, I think you'll find to be quite zazzy.

860
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,079
You should've called soon.

861
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,079
Howard, if you want my help, I've got to know what happened.

862
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:32,079
But it's embarrassing.

863
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,079
Yeah, that's what I'm counting on, spill.

864
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,079
Okay, well, you know a world of warcraft.

865
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:41,079
The online game? Sure.

866
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:46,079
Did you know that the characters in the game can have sex with each other?

867
00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:51,079
Oh God, I think I see where this is going.

868
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:54,079
Her name was Glissinda the Troll.

869
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:02,079
Bernadette walked in on me while we were doing the cybernasty under the bridge of souls.

870
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,079
Oh, you're right, that is so embarrassing.

871
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,079
Would you talk to her?

872
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:11,079
Bernadette or the troll?

873
00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:12,079
Bernadette.

874
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,079
She was so mad at me she wouldn't even listen to my side of the story.

875
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,079
What was your side?

876
00:50:17,079 --> 00:50:20,079
Well, Froino, Glissinda the Troll wasn't even a real woman.

877
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,079
She could've been a 50 year old truck driver in New Jersey.

878
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:27,079
Really, and that didn't make her feel better?

879
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:30,079
Spin class worked up quite a sweat.

880
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,079
Joy, this is Leonard, Leonard, this is Joy.

881
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,079
Hi.

882
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,079
You don't look like a genius.

883
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:40,079
Go ahead and say something smart.

884
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:41,079
Ah, time's up.

885
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,079
Just kidding.

886
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:47,079
First thing you need to know about me, I'm hilarious.

887
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:51,079
Yeah.

888
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,079
So Bernadette tells me she knows you from the self-defense class?

889
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,079
Yeah, it's really Krav Magal, lots of fun.

890
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,079
Basically, a hundred different ways to rip a guy's nuts off.

891
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:05,079
Wow, wouldn't think that'd be that many.

892
00:51:05,079 --> 00:51:06,079
Number 42?

893
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,079
Whoa!

894
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:10,079
Isn't she a parent?

895
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:18,079
The slops do is good on the way down and the way up.

896
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,079
Should be, it's $30 a pound.

897
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,079
Hey, this is a date, right?

898
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:30,079
Yep, it is.

899
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,079
73!

900
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,079
Excuse me, I have to go to the little girls' room and take a wicked wizz.

901
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,079
I'll be the king.

902
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,079
Fair warning, I have the asparagus.

903
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,079
My pee is going to stink up the place.

904
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:48,079
That's okay, you can just sleep here.

905
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:50,079
Oh, good, a slumber party.

906
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,079
We'll do makeovers, initiate phony phone calls and have spirited pillow fights in our frilly nighties.

907
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:00,079
Oh, gosh, Amy, I don't know if I would call this an actual slumber party.

908
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,079
Oh, that's disappointing, I've always wanted to be invited to a slumber party.

909
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,079
Oh, you never were? Not even when you were a kid?

910
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:10,079
Well, there was the time I had my tonsils out and I shared a room with a little Vietnamese girl.

911
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:15,079
She didn't make it through the night, but up till then it was kind of fun.

912
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,079
Okay, well, I guess we're having a slumber party.

913
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:26,079
Pillow fight!

914
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,079
The thing I drew this up, what's that?

915
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:34,079
I present to you the relationship agreement.

916
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:46,079
A binding covenant that in its 31 pages enumerates, iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper,

917
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:52,079
here and after known as the boyfriend, and Amy Farah Fowler, here and after known as the girlfriend.

918
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:55,079
It's so romantic.

919
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,079
Mutual indemnification always is.

920
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,079
Why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp?

921
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,079
Section 5, handholding.

922
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,079
Handholding is only allowed under the following circumstances.

923
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,079
A, either party is in danger of falling off a cliff, precipice or ledge.

924
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,079
B, either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize.

925
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,079
C, moral support during flu shots.

926
00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:32,079
Seems a bit restrictive.

927
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,079
Yeah, feel free to retain a lawyer.

928
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,079
Hey, Cedar, how's it going?

929
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,079
I'm not so good, we have to talk.

930
00:53:39,079 --> 00:53:41,079
Oh, so serious.

931
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,079
Okay, here it is.

932
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:53,079
I met this girl and I kissed her and I feel terrible about it, but it's done, it's never going to happen again, and I am so, so sorry.

933
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,079
Not on, life's okay.

934
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,079
It is.

935
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,079
These things happen. They happen to everybody.

936
00:54:01,079 --> 00:54:04,079
Oh my God, you are amazing.

937
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:08,079
I don't deserve you. Well, what do you mean everybody?

938
00:54:11,079 --> 00:54:13,079
Leonard, I didn't know if I should tell you,

939
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:16,079
but I kind of cheated on you too.

940
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:18,079
I, kind of?

941
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,079
A couple of weeks ago, I slept with my ex-boyfriend.

942
00:54:25,079 --> 00:54:27,079
So I guess we both messed up a little.

943
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:32,079
No, no, I messed up a little, you messed up a lot.

944
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,079
Well, there's not a competition.

945
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:38,079
Oh, we had it, and you won.

946
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:42,079
Good morning, handsome.

947
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:45,079
Morning, mom.

948
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:50,079
It's me.

949
00:54:53,079 --> 00:54:55,079
Yes, it is, and you're so pretty in the morning.

950
00:54:58,079 --> 00:54:59,079
Your mom and I need your breakfast.

951
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,079
Wow, so you guys are getting along?

952
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,079
I guess. We're very different people, Howard, so communication's a little tricky.

953
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:11,079
Does he like the pet pet?

954
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,079
He didn't try them yet.

955
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,079
Is there any butter?

956
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:19,079
Butter flavored syrup.

957
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:21,079
Stop what's the word!

958
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:23,079
He wants butter!

959
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:27,079
It's butter flavored syrup!

960
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,079
I just told him that!

961
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,079
I don't need any butter.

962
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,079
If you want butter, I'll get you butter.

963
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,079
I guess I'll cut these by myself.

964
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,079
Be sure to check the mail.

965
00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:52,079
How many times are you going to tell me?

966
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:54,079
Nothing.

967
00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:56,079
It's about suspicious that I'm fixating.

968
00:55:57,079 --> 00:55:58,079
It's consistent with my personality.

969
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,079
Right.

970
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:03,079
More Halloween candy than she just bought a bunch of it yesterday?

971
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,079
Oh, yeah, that's gone.

972
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,079
It's a rough month when Halloween and PMS sit at the same time.

973
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:14,079
But Leonard doesn't have time to chat. He has to get the mail.

974
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,079
When you relax, I'll get it in a minute.

975
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:19,079
Hey, I was work. Open the mail.

976
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:22,079
Excuse me.

977
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:31,079
Couple of circulars. Nothing important.

978
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:33,079
What's the pin?

979
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,079
Hang on.

980
00:56:41,079 --> 00:56:48,079
You might be from Texas, but I'm from New Jersey.

981
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:52,079
Test my ringtone.

982
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:53,079
Rock is mad!

983
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,079
That really is a good song.

984
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,079
There's a reason he's so old and John, they don't make you a night-feriting wake me up before you go, go.

985
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,079
How are you coming down for breakfast?

986
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:13,079
I told you I have a video conference with NASA. I said don't bother me.

987
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:16,079
Oh, let's have a picture of astronauts.

988
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,079
Yes, please, let's have a picture of astronauts.

989
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,079
Hey, good morning.

990
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,079
Hey, Howard, thanks for getting up so early.

991
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,079
No problem, Dr. Masamino.

992
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:34,079
The guy's here call me mass.

993
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,079
That's a cool nickname because force equals mass times acceleration.

994
00:57:39,079 --> 00:57:41,079
Yeah, it's just short for Masamino.

995
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,079
Anyway, the plan for this morning is to go over to the...

996
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,079
Sorry, my phone.

997
00:57:51,079 --> 00:57:53,079
What is that? Is that rocket man?

998
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:57,079
Yeah, my ringtone, kind of my favorite song, Rocket Man.

999
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,079
How are the Jeff Froot loapting getting soggy?

1000
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:05,079
Not now!

1001
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:07,079
What's that?

1002
00:58:07,079 --> 00:58:09,079
My mom, sorry.

1003
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,079
No problem. Fruit loops.

1004
00:58:13,079 --> 00:58:15,079
I am... I'm lovable.

1005
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:18,079
That's just the booze talking.

1006
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,079
It's not I, but I had a drink since last night.

1007
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,079
You're talking to me?

1008
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,079
I am.

1009
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,079
I'm crying for a whole different reason.

1010
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:45,079
So, I guess what I'm saying is I get where Lucy's coming from.

1011
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,079
That's great. Do you want some wine?

1012
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:48,079
No, what is fine.

1013
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:54,079
I've been thinking about it a lot and I totally see why Lucy did what she did.

1014
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,079
I pushed too hard, but you know what?

1015
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,079
If I back off, maybe give her enough space. Maybe this is in the future for us.

1016
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,079
The funny thing about life is that sometimes something you think is going to be good.

1017
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:06,079
I have a very shat ah.

1018
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,079
And it turns good again and that means it's better than if it had never been bad for a while.

1019
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:11,079
I know you are.

1020
00:59:11,079 --> 00:59:13,079
You are now things aren't good.

1021
00:59:13,079 --> 00:59:16,079
They are in fact very, very bad.

1022
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,079
But at least my heart is trying to heal.

1023
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,079
It was slowly but surely...

1024
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:23,079
How I cried, it was like a little laugh.
