1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,880
You really were a blue coat, weren't you?

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,879
I wasn't blue coat, yeah, at the place you showed.

3
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:06,400
Which was next door to Heisham Nuclear Power Station.

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,240
LAUGHTER

5
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:09,279
I think it is. I got sent there because I was...

6
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,359
I worked a really good one in Yarmouth, great Yarmouth.

7
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:14,720
Got sacked, which is another story.

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,760
And then sacked and then...

9
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,559
What?

10
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:19,839
..and sent to... We'll move on to that in a minute.

11
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,039
Sent to this one.

12
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,240
Sent to that one as a sort of punishment.

13
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,160
It was like, you're going to Morkham to do six months.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,679
Because you have just...

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,199
You've just done something which...

16
00:00:29,239 --> 00:00:30,439
What had you done?

17
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,079
Well, something that was considered cheeky in the 70s,

18
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:34,399
but now is illegal.

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,679
LAUGHTER

20
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:37,679
LAUGHTER

21
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,159
Oh, wow.

22
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:40,640
No, that's not true.

23
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,039
It was actually an incident where...

24
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:44,159
It was my first attempt at stand-up comedy.

25
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:45,920
And what happened was I...

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,280
I'd always wanted to do stand-up comedy.

27
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,679
I didn't have the guts to do it.

28
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:49,719
I got very drunk.

29
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:51,519
I had to go at doing it as a blue coat.

30
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,719
My mate said to me,

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,359
just copy all the other comedians at Ponton's and steal the jokes

32
00:00:56,359 --> 00:00:58,280
and basically talk to the front row.

33
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,000
So you're supposed to say, were you from?

34
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,359
They say Scotland, you say who paid for your holiday,

35
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,480
were you from Wales?

36
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,640
You make a noise like a sheep.

37
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Rubbish jokes, all right?

38
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,760
But I said, that's terrible.

39
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,359
He said, don't worry, you're just padding.

40
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,320
What you're doing is you're looking for comedy gold,

41
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,000
which is, were you from?

42
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,520
They say Kent and you say,

43
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,960
what did you call me?

44
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,960
Right?

45
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,599
Now at Ponton's, this used to take the roof off, right?

46
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,560
LAUGHTER

47
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,760
So I tried it, but I was very drunk.

48
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,719
LAUGHTER

49
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:31,439
So I go on stage and I say, were you from?

50
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,239
The splot says Scotland.

51
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:34,640
I can't remember the joke.

52
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
LAUGHTER

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,319
I say, hello.

54
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,920
LAUGHTER

55
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,599
Then I said to the, were you from?

56
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:43,840
The guy says, Wales, I'd black out and I go,

57
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
hi.

58
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,640
Hi, panic.

59
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
And then I say, anyone in from Kent?

60
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,159
LAUGHTER

61
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,159
LAUGHTER

62
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:57,079
And this splot shout, so me.

63
00:01:57,079 --> 00:01:58,679
LAUGHTER

64
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:01,159
LAUGHTER

65
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,159
And I said...

66
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:04,399
LAUGHTER

67
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:05,799
Well, you're a f***er.

68
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,519
LAUGHTER

69
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:09,519
APPLAUSE

70
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,519
LAUGHTER

71
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:13,599
That's so, that's so...

72
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,000
That's so...

73
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
LAUGHTER

74
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,800
LAUGHTER

75
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,599
So I miss it.

76
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:22,599
LAUGHTER

77
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:24,639
I'm such a moron.

78
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:25,639
LAUGHTER

79
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:26,639
That's...

80
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:27,639
Fifty Shades darker.

81
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:29,639
But actually, this isn't darker.

82
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,159
It's more romantic, I would say.

83
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:33,639
Yeah, I think that's probably true, yeah.

84
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:37,799
Yes, but there's probably more sex in it, which...

85
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:39,799
LAUGHTER

86
00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:41,799
More sex?

87
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:42,799
It is.

88
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:43,799
Jamie doesn't speak.

89
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:45,799
LAUGHTER

90
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,799
I make noises.

91
00:02:47,799 --> 00:02:49,799
LAUGHTER

92
00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:51,479
I make like...

93
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:54,039
I'm not very good at accenting noises, though.

94
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:55,039
No, there's...

95
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:56,439
You know, there's actually a question, though.

96
00:02:56,439 --> 00:02:57,840
Do they let you do that?

97
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,039
I mean, like, when you're...

98
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,839
When you're doing the scenes, does the directors say...

99
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,839
More vocalization?

100
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:05,839
I mean, there's often...

101
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,839
There's often so...

102
00:03:07,839 --> 00:03:08,839
There's often so...

103
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,839
Ah!

104
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,839
No, that's not good.

105
00:03:11,839 --> 00:03:13,839
No one comes like that.

106
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,839
LAUGHTER

107
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:17,839
That's all I do.

108
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:19,839
That is you.

109
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,840
Like we do, man.

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
There's some scenes where...

111
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,840
They will play music, maybe, a bit of it.

112
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,199
If it's a wide shot, and it's not like...

113
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,719
So, it's the closest we get to sort of kind of...

114
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,599
Sort of just sort of going forward in one piece,

115
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,400
and they'll play music or something.

116
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,319
And my temptation is always just to try to make the cuttle-off.

117
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,319
So, sometimes, I'll do things like...

118
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,879
When there's a moment where I'm meant to, you know, orgasm,

119
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,520
I'll be like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

120
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,520
LAUGHTER

121
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,520
People do that.

122
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,520
Which, by the way, if they don't, they should.

123
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,520
It's not a Ryan Airflite when a Ryan Airflite lands.

124
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
Give it a little...

125
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,520
LAUGHTER

126
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Oh, yeah.

127
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
Well...

128
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
And was it nice of you this time?

129
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,520
Because last time it was you and sort of everyone else

130
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,519
was a woman, the director, or whatever you...

131
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,519
But this time it's a man directing, that makes a difference.

132
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,519
No, not really, to be honest.

133
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,519
I mean, I think whoever is tasked with directing those kind of scenes,

134
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,519
I mean, you know, these guys know it.

135
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,519
Sex scenes are awkward, anyway.

136
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,519
And it just needs a very...

137
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,519
This wild love, how?

138
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,519
Because he includes me in... Yeah, you know.

139
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:41,519
These guys know sex scenes are just really hard.

140
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,519
It's like, no, babe.

141
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,519
No, you know what?

142
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,519
Ever done a sex scene?

143
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,519
What?

144
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,519
We've been in so many films.

145
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
I know.

146
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:53,519
I'm from somebody at some point.

147
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,519
No, no, no, no.

148
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:56,519
Not in Back in the Harvest? No.

149
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,519
I might have been on a couple of people under that habit,

150
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,519
but...

151
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:02,519
No, no, no, no.

152
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,519
Why is that your decision?

153
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,519
No.

154
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,519
This is based on your life.

155
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,519
I mean, this is things...

156
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,519
Yeah.

157
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,519
Loosely, Graham.

158
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:19,519
There were things like, isn't the washing machine that happened to you?

159
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:20,519
What?

160
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,519
The washing.

161
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:23,519
You were very hungover.

162
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:24,519
Oh.

163
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:26,519
Yeah.

164
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,519
Tell Tony Foster, that story.

165
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:33,519
All less toys are really cool, though, Graham.

166
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
When I was teaching, which is what this show is based on,

167
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,519
I went home one weekend, and I was in my 30s.

168
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,519
I was probably 33 years of age.

169
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,519
I went home to see my mother, and then I went back.

170
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,519
And while I was at home, my mother did my washing for me,

171
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:51,519
because I was only 33.

172
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,519
And then I went back.

173
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,519
On the Sunday night, I got really drunk,

174
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,519
and then I went for a curry.

175
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:04,519
And then the next day I went into school.

176
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,519
I'm going to.

177
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,519
I went into school, and it was a school in Slau,

178
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:10,519
and it was quite a rough school,

179
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,519
and I was really brilliant hearing impaired department,

180
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,519
so there were hearing impaired kids who struggled.

181
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:18,519
They really looked after in the school.

182
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,519
Anyway, I was really hungover.

183
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:23,519
I went there, and at about break time I felt really uncomfortable.

184
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,519
I thought something's not right, you know?

185
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,519
So I went to the toilet, and I pulled my trousers down,

186
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:36,519
and some of my mother's necks have got mixed up in the washing.

187
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,519
And I was wearing my mother's underwear.

188
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,519
And I went, oh, God, no!

189
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:45,519
I remember going, oh, are you loser?

190
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,519
It's such a low point, you fucking loser.

191
00:06:48,519 --> 00:06:56,519
And then the curry and the booze kicked in from the night before.

192
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:01,519
So I did like a fecal Jackson Pollock.

193
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:08,519
And I started going, oh, God, not this.

194
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Not this as well.

195
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:12,519
Oh, Jesus.

196
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,519
So I cleaned myself up, and I pulled my mother's pants back there.

197
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,519
And I went back into the classroom,

198
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,519
and I saw one of the hearing impaired kids just looking at me like this.

199
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,519
And that's when I remembered that I had a microphone directly.

200
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,519
LAUGHTER

201
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,519
I couldn't have seen it.

202
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,519
Here we go.

203
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,519
APPLAUSE

204
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,519
LAUGHTER

205
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,519
LAUGHTER

206
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,519
So maybe, man, down isn't that far fetched.

207
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,519
John, for you, obviously,

208
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:49,519
lovely that Emily wants to be in the film.

209
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,519
Absolutely.

210
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,519
But as a director, is it then weird giving your life partner notes?

211
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:57,519
It was weird, because I was very nervous about, to be honest.

212
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,519
I think we both were.

213
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,519
Before we started shooting, she said, are you nervous?

214
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,519
And I said, I'm terrified.

215
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,519
And she said, oh, good, me too.

216
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,519
I think it's one of those things where people think

217
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,519
because we're both in the same business, we have the same experiences.

218
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:11,519
But I've actually never been on set with her, seen how she worked.

219
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,519
I'd heard she was a diva, and I just...

220
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:15,519
LAUGHTER

221
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,519
I can't get Emily out of her trailer, stuff like that.

222
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,519
It's like, oh.

223
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,519
And no, but I think what it was is...

224
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:23,519
And it sounds really sappy, but it's true.

225
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,519
I think it's the greatest collaboration I've ever had in my career.

226
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:28,519
I've never seen her work.

227
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,519
And when you are actually in the room when she does what she does,

228
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,519
it, honestly, it changes the air in the room.

229
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,519
Everyone is just completely and totally stunned by what she does.

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,519
It's all...

231
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:37,519
The sneer!

232
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,519
But I can't really hear you off.

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,519
I have to say this is what...

234
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,519
This is what I actually learned early on in our relationship.

235
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,519
Was it British people are notoriously terrible at taking compliments?

236
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,519
Which you agree? Just like...

237
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,519
LAUGHTER

238
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:56,519
I always thought, oh, guys...

239
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,519
Oh, that's actually what she did.

240
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:00,519
People are saying, it's like, I just want to get out of the way.

241
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,519
I'm a huge fan of yours and...

242
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:03,519
Oh!

243
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,519
I was like, oh, no!

244
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,519
Later!

245
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,519
You weren't cool at all.

246
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:07,519
There was none of that.

247
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,519
Actually, I don't know your work.

248
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,519
You were a proper fan of it.

249
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:11,519
Oh, I'm going.

250
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,519
I was full stock or status.

251
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,519
Yeah.

252
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,519
I was just like, hey, you want to go out and date with me?

253
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,519
No, tell me, but how many times have you seen Devil Wars Prada?

254
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,519
I mean...

255
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,519
Not 75.

256
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,519
Give or take 72.

257
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,519
No, it's one of those things that back in the day,

258
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:29,519
us elderly people used to channel serve.

259
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,519
And no one does that anymore, but...

260
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,519
What's that?

261
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,519
LAUGHTER

262
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,519
Like I said, a painting tool.

263
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
Oh, it's just one of those movies that whatever...

264
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,519
Whenever you're going through the channels, you just stop and you...

265
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,519
I mean, look.

266
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,519
Has anyone seen the film here?

267
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,519
Probably.

268
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,519
Do you know that there's...

269
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:48,519
There's a sort of montage sequence where Annie Hathaway's got

270
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:50,519
numerous fabulous outfits that they go through.

271
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,519
And John, one day, I came home and he was watching it.

272
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:57,519
And he was watching the montage, but then he goes...

273
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,519
And...

274
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,519
That's my favorite outfit.

275
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:01,519
LAUGHTER

276
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
LAUGHTER

277
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,519
That's not in the meanies.

278
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,519
Oh, I couldn't get Annie in so I'm like...

279
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
LAUGHTER

280
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,519
You're talking about that.

281
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,519
You're talking about the new album, Bush.

282
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,519
And a very sexy bit of PR, of course, that the mighty Farell...

283
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,519
He co-wrote...

284
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,519
Do you write all the songs?

285
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,519
He produced the whole album.

286
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,519
Produced the whole album.

287
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,519
Yes, sir.

288
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,519
Wow.

289
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,519
Is it true that Farell, he was the one encouraging you

290
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,519
to be a bit more family-friendly, a bit more mainstream-wise?

291
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,519
Yeah, yeah, he...

292
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,519
Made me change certain words.

293
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,519
I had a song called So Many Holes.

294
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:38,519
He made it So Many Proves.

295
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:40,519
LAUGHTER

296
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,519
Well, that certainly toned it down.

297
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:44,519
LAUGHTER

298
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,519
On prose, just prostitutes.

299
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,519
No, they're professionals.

300
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:49,519
Oh, I see.

301
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:50,519
LAUGHTER

302
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,519
Silly me.

303
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,519
LAUGHTER

304
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,519
The ladies in the video still look quite like hoes.

305
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,519
LAUGHTER

306
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,519
They're professional.

307
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,519
LAUGHTER

308
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,519
They're in a video.

309
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,519
And then Farell, is it true that he...

310
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
I mean, I'm sure he enjoyed working with you,

311
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,519
but he did have some difficulties working with you as well.

312
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,519
Yeah, and when we were working on a particular song

313
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:17,519
called California Raw, Stevie Wonder,

314
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,519
he came up to the studio and for real,

315
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
he called a second hand contact

316
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,519
from being in the studio with me.

317
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,519
And he kind of froze.

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,519
He didn't know how to produce it anymore.

319
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
He was stuck. He was like...

320
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
Might have to explain what the...

321
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,519
Yes. So Farell was in an environment created by Snoop.

322
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,519
LAUGHTER

323
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,519
Farell was no longer the same Farell.

324
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,519
It's not the same.

325
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:45,519
Yes.

326
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,519
He was now someone else.

327
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,519
LAUGHTER

328
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,519
He was not the greatest producer in the world.

329
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,519
He was the greatest producer in the world.

330
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,519
He was just a guy in the room.

331
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,519
LAUGHTER

332
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,519
So was Stevie Wonder trying to talk to him?

333
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,519
Stevie Wonder was in the mic booth.

334
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,519
Yeah, you know Stevie can't see.

335
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,519
So Stevie was waiting on some direction.

336
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,519
And Farell was again, you know,

337
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,519
directed for Stevie, which is in there just...

338
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,519
This is weird.

339
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,519
I don't answer this question if you don't want to matter.

340
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,519
But I have...

341
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,519
I don't know why you brought this up,

342
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,519
but I did hear you discuss...

343
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,519
an extraordinary disagreement with your wife about yourself.

344
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,519
Do you know what I'm talking about?

345
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,519
By myself, you mean...

346
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:27,519
Yes.

347
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,519
Oh.

348
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,519
Yes.

349
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:32,519
Listen, have you known this story?

350
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,519
I do not know this question.

351
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
I do not know this question.

352
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,519
Well, as you do, we were talking about stuff.

353
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,519
I've done...

354
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,519
I just have no interest in, and of course,

355
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:44,519
being circumcised, I said.

356
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:46,519
LAUGHTER

357
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:48,519
They were chatting. They're married.

358
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:50,519
They're allowed.

359
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,519
And she said...

360
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:53,519
She said,

361
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,519
You're not circumcised?

362
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,519
I said, what do you mean?

363
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:00,519
You've only known me a few...

364
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,519
All my life, I remember my mother telling me why,

365
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,519
because it was fashionable at the time.

366
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,519
She said, You're not circumcised.

367
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,519
I said, That's ridiculous.

368
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,519
I should know if I'm circumcised.

369
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,519
Of course I am.

370
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
End of conversation.

371
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,519
Next day, I happened to be seeing my doctor.

372
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,519
LAUGHTER

373
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,519
Are you okay?

374
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,519
LAUGHTER

375
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,519
I was seeing my doctor for my annual physical, of course.

376
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:27,519
So...

377
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
Well, he was down there.

378
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,519
LAUGHTER

379
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,519
I said, It's getting dark, by the way.

380
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,519
Erve.

381
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,519
My wife and I are in a little disagreement.

382
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,519
I am circumcised, I'm high,

383
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:44,519
because she says, I'm not.

384
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,519
And he goes...

385
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,519
LAUGHTER

386
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,519
Not.

387
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:52,519
LAUGHTER

388
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,519
It's not possible.

389
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,519
So he looked down again and he said, Hey, I'm Jewish.

390
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,519
I know the difference.

391
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,519
That is a bizarre story.

392
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,519
That is a bizarre story.

393
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,519
LAUGHTER

394
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,519
Oh, God.

395
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,519
I have grandchildren.

396
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
LAUGHTER

397
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,519
You're going to have to change your Facebook status, isn't it?

398
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,519
Yes. No more beef stew.

399
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,519
Well, there's more beef stew.

400
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,519
Because when you were starting off in wrestling,

401
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,519
you had a persona that, Am I right?

402
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,519
Well, sort of half-man, half-machine.

403
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,519
Yes, that's correct. Yes.

404
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,519
It was prototype. It was awful.

405
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,519
LAUGHTER

406
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,519
So you want to try to find a persona, or here's some more

407
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:50,519
inside Facebook, where a gimmick,

408
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:52,519
where it describes you as a character,

409
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,519
so when you walk out, people notice you,

410
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
and you can describe your character.

411
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,519
But these are not gimmicks. This is real.

412
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:03,519
Well, well, I mean, if they work.

413
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,519
Yes.

414
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,519
But you kind of...

415
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,519
It's a trial and error process with a lot of errors.

416
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,519
And my first try was the prototype,

417
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,519
which was half-man and half-machine,

418
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:14,519
and 100% crap.

419
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:15,519
LAUGHTER

420
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,519
But given that you're not half a machine,

421
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
how did you demonstrate you were a machine?

422
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,519
Well, I used this ability to talk rather monotone,

423
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:26,519
and would say things authoritative,

424
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:29,519
and just when I said I would kick your ass at the fairgrounds

425
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,519
on Sunday, I would rewind it and say it again for you.

426
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,519
I would say, I would kick your ass at the fairgrounds.

427
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,519
Did it work?

428
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,519
You know.

429
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,519
Oh, it didn't.

430
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:43,519
That's a good one.

431
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,519
Yeah, you've worked on one.

432
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,519
I have one.

433
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,519
You found you success as John Cena.

434
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,519
Imagine that.

435
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,519
I figure I need to come up with some sort of name.

436
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,519
Yeah, look, everyone...

437
00:15:54,519 --> 00:15:55,519
Doesn't everyone...

438
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,519
Every wrestler has a name.

439
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,519
Yes, and people think that, like, hey, man,

440
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,519
how'd you make up the name John Cena?

441
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:02,519
It's like, no, dude, out of made up like Dick Hammerbush

442
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:04,519
or something cool like that.

443
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,519
No, Dick Hammerbush.

444
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:07,519
Or something, I don't know.

445
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,519
That's a star.

446
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,519
No, it's moving there.

447
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:12,519
No one's letting you go out with that, no?

448
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,519
But they actually think that John Cena is a gimmick name,

449
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:18,519
but no, that's actually...

450
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,519
Through all the presentation that is WWE, I'm stuck with Josh.

451
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
Are you wrestling fan, Jamie?

452
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,519
I used to love wrestling when we were much younger,

453
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,519
about the same time as Transformers, back in the day.

454
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,519
We had Big Daddy.

455
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,519
Yeah.

456
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,519
The giant haystack.

457
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:34,519
No, no.

458
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:35,519
No, I love it.

459
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,519
I love it.

460
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,519
I thought it was just fantastic.

461
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,519
By the way, I'm John Cena.

462
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,519
That was awesome names.

463
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,519
You know, you're the ultimate drooler or, like, nothing else.

464
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,519
I just like to have signature moves, I think.

465
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,519
Yes.

466
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:49,519
And one of yours is the...

467
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,519
You can't see me, but that's correct.

468
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,519
Is that true that came out of your family somehow?

469
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,519
Yeah, I was dared to do it.

470
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:58,519
So I was actually making the music for my own theme song

471
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,519
that you just so heard and finally serenaded me to.

472
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,519
Thank you very much.

473
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,519
And we played it for my brother.

474
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,519
And the first time he heard it, this was the 50 cents crew

475
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:11,519
had a really popular song called In The Club.

476
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,519
And he heard it the first time, and instead of dancing,

477
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,519
like, he was our litmus test to see what songs were good,

478
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,519
what songs were bad.

479
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:18,519
He did this.

480
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:20,519
Oh, my God.

481
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:22,519
And I'm like, dude, what are you doing?

482
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:23,519
He's like, no, everybody does this, man.

483
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:24,519
Everybody does this.

484
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,519
And I guess this was from 50 cents video.

485
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:29,519
And he's like, you won't do it on TV.

486
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:30,519
What the hell do I have to lose?

487
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:31,519
Am I going to fire me?

488
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,519
Of course I'll do it on TV.

489
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,519
But instead of doing this, I did this.

490
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,519
And now for 15 years.

491
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:43,519
Because of a dare.

492
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,519
I've been doing this.

493
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,519
And I'll do you one better.

494
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:50,519
People actually think I'm invisible.

495
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:52,519
There will be people to look at this couch.

496
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,519
And be like, why is there nobody next to McConnell, hey?

497
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,519
You said Joe and Cena would be there, but we can't see him.

498
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:02,519
So you never know.

499
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,519
You remember Hacksaw Jim Douglas,

500
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:07,519
and you King Kong Bunny, Skandar, Ack bars,

501
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,519
and Caravan Erics, and Carie the Claw,

502
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:12,519
I got a kick out of Hershkall.

503
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:13,519
Let's talk in Texas Wrestling.

504
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,519
I get kicked out of Hershkall, see him in Treyport,

505
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:20,519
for pelting Skandar Ackbar, the bag of tomatoes, on the Ackbar.

506
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,519
Skandar Ackbar was a man dressed as a sheep

507
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,519
that used to throw fire.

508
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,519
Yes.

509
00:18:24,519 --> 00:18:26,519
And he managed King Kong Bunny,

510
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,519
who was like 484 pounds.

511
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:31,519
And remember there's Missy Leeds from Parton None,

512
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,519
and then Ah.

513
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,519
And then the Green Face, Spit Green Mr.

514
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:35,519
They sound really good.

515
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,519
Good stuff.

516
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,519
Yeah, they're entertaining.

517
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:38,519
Here's something I'm talking about.

518
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:40,519
And I'm John Cena.

519
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:42,519
And you've got the King Kong Bunny,

520
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:43,519
here's the Red Bull.

521
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:44,519
Hello.

522
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,519
Hi, what's your name?

523
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,519
James. James, lovely James.

524
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,519
And what do you do?

525
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:48,519
I'm a civil servant.

526
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:50,519
A civil servant, lovely, in London here?

527
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,519
Yes, in London.

528
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,519
And are you from the London area?

529
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,519
No, I live in London, but I'm originally from Suffolk.

530
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:57,519
Oh. Oh.

531
00:18:57,519 --> 00:18:58,519
Yeah, mate.

532
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,519
It's a Suffolk Massive.

533
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:00,519
Yeah.

534
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:02,519
Isn't mentioned in the song.

535
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:03,519
Probably, yeah.

536
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,519
What school did you go to?

537
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,519
So, I went to Brandistan.

538
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:09,519
Oh, sweet, yeah.

539
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,519
I went to the primary school.

540
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,519
Yeah.

541
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:12,519
Okay.

542
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,519
Did we know each other?

543
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,519
Yeah.

544
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:15,519
Did we?

545
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,519
I'm not wearing my glasses.

546
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:20,519
I'm not wearing my glasses.

547
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:21,519
What did you say, James?

548
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:22,519
I know.

549
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:23,519
James.

550
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,519
Yes.

551
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:25,519
Me.

552
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:26,519
That's the one.

553
00:19:26,519 --> 00:19:28,519
What the fuck?

554
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:30,519
Do you do this with my best mate growing up?

555
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:31,519
You're giving him.

556
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,519
And now you're talking to him, me, on a monastery.

557
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,519
I'm not having my specs and he's like, oh my god.

558
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,519
Can we not flip him and just get him out of here?

559
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:41,519
Yeah, yeah.

560
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:43,519
Do you have a sorry or do you?

561
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:44,519
Well, yeah, I did, but it's okay.

562
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:45,519
Please let it be about edge.

563
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:47,519
It's about edge.

564
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,519
Okay, tell your story.

565
00:19:48,519 --> 00:19:49,519
Then we'll flip you and then...

566
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:50,519
I'm a civil servant.

567
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,519
Okay, cool.

568
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:52,519
So, yeah, as Edward said.

569
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:53,519
This is so random, mate.

570
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,519
It's what it is.

571
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:57,519
Yeah, when we were younger, Ed used to come around to my house and yeah, like you're saying,

572
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,519
we used to be quite good mates.

573
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:05,519
And I remember one time he was coming around for tea and I forgot to tell Mum that he was a vegetarian,

574
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:07,519
at that point anyway.

575
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,519
And so Mum cooked, I think, the sausages and mashed for tea.

576
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,519
And Ed said, you know, after the meal, these are the best sausages I've ever tasted.

577
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,519
You know, where did you get them from?

578
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,519
Mum had to lie because she had no clue.

579
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:19,519
And so, yeah.

580
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:21,519
For 16 years later, I'm pretty sorry.

581
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:23,519
First time I ever had me.

582
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:26,519
And also the first time I ever watched a Simpsons episode was around your house as well.

583
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:28,519
Okay, well done, you've got to flip you now.

584
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,519
We can be reunited backstage.

585
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:31,519
Okay, okay.

586
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,519
Oh, okay.

587
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,519
There it goes.

588
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:35,519
It's coming.

589
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:36,519
It's coming.

590
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,519
It's coming.

591
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:38,519
It's coming.

592
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:39,519
It's coming.

593
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:40,519
It's coming.

594
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,519
It's coming.

595
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,519
It's coming.

596
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:43,519
It's coming.

597
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:44,519
It's coming.

598
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,519
I feel like Cilla Black on Surprise, Surprise.

599
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,519
There it is.

600
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,519
Come on.

601
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,519
We just, we just surrender me.

602
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:58,519
I'm gonna look something like you know.

603
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:01,519
Have a seat, have a seat, have a seat, dude.

604
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,519
One of the things you can do is you can conjure up people's fears.

605
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:07,519
Yes.

606
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:08,519
Okay.

607
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:10,519
So you, you're afraid of quite basic things.

608
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:11,519
You yourself.

609
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:13,519
I'm afraid of like most things.

610
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:15,519
Like anything high risk I'm terrified of.

611
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:16,519
But those irrational fears.

612
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:20,519
Okay, irrational is the spiders, because, but they actually, um,

613
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,519
I become paralyzed when I, when I have a spider in my room.

614
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:25,519
Really?

615
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:28,519
Yeah, I like wish I were tougher than that, but I'm not.

616
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,519
Okay.

617
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,519
Now, small rough low, we use serious when you told us what your fear is.

618
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,519
I mean, it is, it's a good fear.

619
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:37,519
It's, I think it's a founded fear.

620
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:38,519
I think it's a founded fear.

621
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:39,519
It is.

622
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:40,519
Tell us what it is.

623
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,519
I have a phobia of being chased around with poop on a stick.

624
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:48,519
LAUGHTER

625
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,519
Is that fair?

626
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,519
Yeah, I wouldn't say, I just say we've all got that fear.

627
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:56,519
There's another one that goes, not up for that.

628
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,519
It started when I was a kid.

629
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,519
It was just weird parenting.

630
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:08,519
For some reason, kids thought it was funny to stick a stick in dog poop

631
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,519
and chase each other around with it.

632
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:13,519
But that scared the crap out of me.

633
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,519
Because of the cleanliness problem of it, with spreading germs?

634
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,519
No, because of poop.

635
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:20,519
It's just dogs poop.

636
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:23,519
It's just a parade of sticks.

637
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,519
Now, Jeremy Ranado, yours is brilliantly specific,

638
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,519
and I think without knowing it, I think we probably all share it.

639
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:33,519
We may.

640
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:34,519
I don't know.

641
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,519
I didn't have the fear when I was younger, because we've all, we all go through this,

642
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:40,519
but it's when a little child, and I'm the oldest of seven kids,

643
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,519
and I got a lot of little rug rests running around,

644
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,519
and these little roaches start losing their teeth.

645
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:47,519
And they get a little wiggly, and they like to show me,

646
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,519
like this little dagger flipping in and out of their mouth,

647
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,519
and like, look up to Jeremy when it pulls his thing out.

648
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:55,519
I'm like, I can get out of here, freaking me out.

649
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,519
But do you think that is really freaky?

650
00:22:57,519 --> 00:22:59,519
It's like her thumb.

651
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:01,519
It's just weird, it's just again.

652
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,519
No.

653
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,519
It's just really kind of grossed me out.

654
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,519
The cutest little thing on the planet starts to do, like, the creepiest thing on the planet.

655
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,519
And I'm like, get out of here.

656
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,519
I'm like, you're tied to string to my thing, to the door knob.

657
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,519
I'm like, get out of here, creep.

658
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,519
You got to see the animal?

659
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:19,519
I'm a little bit scared of this touch.

660
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:20,519
That's now.

661
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:21,519
No!

662
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,519
No one's running around flipping their little teeth fall on out.

663
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:29,519
Look, we all have this, you know, when you have the dreams, your teeth fall out.

664
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,519
I don't know what it means.

665
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:31,519
Anybody want to means?

666
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,519
We get bigger than ones.

667
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:36,519
No, you're bad dreams.

668
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,519
It's not the only one that is bad dreams.

669
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,519
No, we're your friends.

670
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,519
I've said the one I just had that dream too.

671
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:42,519
You said you were really, weren't it?

672
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:43,519
Yeah, not me.

673
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:44,519
What does that mean?

674
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:45,519
I don't know.

675
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:46,519
I don't know.

676
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:47,519
This is strange.

677
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:48,519
I'm sure of money, I think.

678
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,519
I think that's what the teeth fall on.

679
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,519
Who has fear of money?

680
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,519
Maybe I'm just afraid of my teeth fucking falling out.

681
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:56,519
That's right.

682
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:04,519
Josh, look at you up here.

683
00:24:04,519 --> 00:24:05,519
What are you afraid of?

684
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,519
Well, advertisers are going to go with flying, but I think I'll go with...

685
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,519
Girls over 12?

686
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,519
Stop, stop, stop!

687
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,519
I'm not going to lie.

688
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:31,519
Come on.

689
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:33,519
Come back here, my brother.

690
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,519
Come back here, my brother.

691
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,519
I feel terrible.

692
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:39,519
I don't know what came over me.

693
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,519
I'm not going to lie to you.

694
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:48,519
The last minute of my life, I wouldn't have predicted that.

695
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:51,519
How was it, Mark Ruffalo?

696
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,519
You're not going to believe what he said to me.

697
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,519
He was bang on the money.

698
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:02,519
Very perceptive, man.

699
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:05,519
It was your darapalm.

700
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,519
Don't try and justify it.

701
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,519
Do you know what?

702
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,519
I've always hated the hulk, he's shit.

703
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:14,519
You're making me angry.

704
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,519
You're making me angry.

705
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,519
You're making me angry, Ruffalo.

706
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,519
My son stood up to me the other day when he was mad at me.

707
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:26,519
What do you like him?

708
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,519
I always hated the hulk, I think he's shit.

709
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,519
I think he just told him there was afraid of girls over 12.

710
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:37,519
For him, that would be okay.

711
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,519
He's a tough guy.

712
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,519
Hi, what's your name?

713
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:42,519
My name is Sebastian.

714
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,519
Sebastian.

715
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:44,519
Where are you from?

716
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:45,519
I'm from Newcastle.

717
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,519
Newcastle?

718
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,519
Do you live there or here?

719
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:48,519
I live in Newcastle.

720
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,519
I'll figure out where this was, Sebastian.

721
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,519
Many moons ago, I went to school in Newcastle.

722
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,519
There was a disco coming up.

723
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,519
There was a popular girl at school.

724
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,519
She was like a scenario, all the guys after it.

725
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:09,519
I waited for the last moment, last couple of days.

726
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,519
And as a girl, one of this popular girl had a question.

727
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:15,519
If she'd like to go with me, she said yes.

728
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,519
This was literally the day before the disco.

729
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:23,519
Lo and behold, turns out she was actually going to go with somebody else.

730
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,519
And that other person was actually Charlie.

731
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,519
Sebastian Lippiatt.

732
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:29,519
Sebastian Lippiatt.

733
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:30,519
Sebastian Lippiatt.

734
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,519
Sebastian Lippiatt.

735
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,519
I didn't know.

736
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,519
I was just a minute.

737
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:41,519
How could this have happened to two people?

738
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:43,519
Rachel Gold.

739
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,519
They're very same.

740
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,519
Yeah, she know who it is.

741
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,519
Wow.

742
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:50,519
You look older than me.

743
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,519
You look older than me.

744
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:53,519
You look older than me.

745
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:55,519
Where does that image?

746
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,519
And did you end up marrying Rachel Gold?

747
00:26:58,519 --> 00:26:59,519
No, not yet.

748
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:00,519
No.

749
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,519
Still time.

750
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:05,519
You know, it all happens out of a sword with you, do you?

751
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:09,519
You could ask revenge if you want to.

752
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,519
Do you want to?

753
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,519
There you go.

754
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,519
All of a year.

755
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:15,519
Oh, wow.

756
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,519
We thought we'd seen you play everything, but first which?

757
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:21,519
Mostly bitches.

758
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,519
My first which.

759
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,519
But here you went through a phase you got offered a lot of witches.

760
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:33,519
When I was 40, when I turned 40, I was offered three witches in one year.

761
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,519
And it was sending me a signal I felt.

762
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,519
Probably didn't know how they felt about people turning 40.

763
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:48,519
So I felt bad and it made me sort of, I had a little, my back up, you know.

764
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,519
And so, no, I didn't want to play them.

765
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:54,519
So lots changed in the last five years for you.

766
00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:56,519
Oh, good, mom.

767
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:58,519
Good.

768
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,519
Oh.

769
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,519
You're right.

770
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,519
That's a nice smile.

771
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:07,519
That's a good smile.

772
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,519
I was looking for a fear of solving it.

773
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:12,519
That's seen in episode one.

774
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,519
The doctor's thing.

775
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:14,519
Yeah.

776
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,519
Did that really happen?

777
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:16,519
Yeah.

778
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,519
My mum will kill me for telling this because it was my, our family doctors.

779
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:25,519
And I, he'd been, my family, my doctor since I was a child.

780
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,519
But I went to, as an adult, because I was,

781
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,519
there was something wrong with my bum.

782
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,519
When you said bum, you looked at me directly in the eyes and I'm sorry.

783
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:38,519
I'm sorry.

784
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,519
I mean, I'm a rouse, done unnerved and you call me?

785
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,519
There was something, but there was something wrong with my bum.

786
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:52,519
I could see it was magic.

787
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,519
And I was, I said, there's this thing wrong with my bum and he went,

788
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,519
OK.

789
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,519
And I went, so what did he say?

790
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,519
He goes, well, it'll probably be all right.

791
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:07,519
And I said, well, I, I, I, I, which really like it.

792
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,519
I'd like you to just, if you could make me feel better about,

793
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,519
if I feel better that it will be all right.

794
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,519
And he went, it, it'll probably clear itself up.

795
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,519
And I said, yeah, but, is there any way I could be sure?

796
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,519
And he went, ah.

797
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,519
Do you want me to put my finger up there, don't you?

798
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:31,519
I'm sitting on it.

799
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:36,519
Not if it's not magically necessary.

800
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,519
And, and the other, I think, maybe, maybe there's a reason,

801
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:45,519
but what is the reason that you film it in the school you used to teach in?

802
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,519
I think it's therapy, probably.

803
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,519
I mean, that's a classroom where I taught,

804
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,519
because I was just to keep the theme going, a real teacher for a long time.

805
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:57,519
Yeah, but six years in the school that we film it in the classroom that I'm going mad in.

806
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,519
But that's really...

807
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,519
Well, that was my classroom, yeah.

808
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:02,519
But you did it for such a long time, did you ever enjoy it?

809
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:04,519
Was there ever a moment when you thought, oh, I like this?

810
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:05,519
Oh, no.

811
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:06,519
Okay.

812
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,519
Well, I met some very nice people there.

813
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,519
And the kids were so like, you were nominated for Teacher of the Year, weren't you?

814
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,519
Yes, I was great.

815
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,519
I was.

816
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:18,519
Yeah.

817
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:19,519
Yeah, you know, yes.

818
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,519
I've told this story many times.

819
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,519
But Teacher of the Year is a very prestigious award,

820
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,519
that's taken very seriously and rightly by the hard-working teaching community.

821
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,519
And my head teacher called me in, and he was wetting himself laughing.

822
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,519
If I couldn't stop laughing for the first ten minutes, he went,

823
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,519
I went, what...

824
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,519
Why have you called me here?

825
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:40,519
He goes, you've been nominated.

826
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:43,519
You've been nominated.

827
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:45,519
I've got this.

828
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:49,519
I've got a Teacher of the Year award, you've been nominated.

829
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,519
And I went, oh, okay.

830
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,519
And it was by a very sweet girl called Gemma, I've humiliated many times.

831
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,519
And it's a six-page document that people have to fill in

832
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,519
for the reasons why you should be nominated for Teacher of the Year.

833
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,519
It was blank,

834
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:05,519
aside from one sentence that she'd written on it,

835
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,519
which was of the reasons why you think he should be Teacher of the Year,

836
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:10,519
and she'd written, he's a well-good laugh,

837
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,519
and he don't make us do no work.

838
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,519
Well, your character's name is Dr. Smolder Brevestone.

839
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:18,519
Yes.

840
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,519
So, all the characters have strengths.

841
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,519
So, one of your strengths is the Smolder.

842
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,519
An actual Smolder, yes.

843
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,519
It just takes over, and I have no control of it.

844
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,519
And did you know you could Smolder?

845
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,519
Like, did you kind of think, yeah, when you were doing your Reddit,

846
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,519
you got to go, oh, yeah, I'll do my Smolder.

847
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:34,519
You know?

848
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,519
I take you.

849
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,519
Is that it?

850
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,519
No, it didn't come, yeah.

851
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,519
Oh, okay, okay.

852
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,519
That literally is where it came from.

853
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,519
What you're saying, and this is why he looked at me,

854
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:42,519
because it's so frustrating.

855
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:43,519
Just go ahead.

856
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,519
Tell a story about your stupid Smolder.

857
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,519
No.

858
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,519
It's one of those things that, you know,

859
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,519
is we're developing the script and thinking,

860
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,519
well, what could be a fun thing?

861
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,519
Well, what if a fun thing, one of the fun things was he has this ability

862
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,519
to Smolder, and it just takes over him.

863
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,519
He has no control of it.

864
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,519
And it's just one of those things.

865
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,519
Graham, that God delivered, I signed for it.

866
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,519
And then, just do it.

867
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
And everywhere, everyone likes it.

868
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,519
And everyone loves it.

869
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:09,519
Except one individual.

870
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,519
Everyone loves it.

871
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
I'm going to tell you what it is, okay.

872
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,519
Now, we are very close.

873
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,519
We have very close his friends.

874
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,519
And, you know, in this position, he's a producer on the film.

875
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,519
So sometimes, I just bit my tongue.

876
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:28,519
So this idea came up from a producer like mentality.

877
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,519
Oh, you know what it'd be great for this character?

878
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,519
Well, I know I know.

879
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,519
If he's Smolder, not like what?

880
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:33,519
You know what?

881
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
You know, if he did a thing.

882
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:36,519
And I was like, what the hell are you doing?

883
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,519
Being like in the game.

884
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:40,519
He's like, it's a thing.

885
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:42,519
And then he's born and back.

886
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:45,519
He's like, my mom used to do it to me when I was...

887
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,519
When I was on the mountain.

888
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:50,519
And that's why we listened to him.

889
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:51,519
Because he's born and back.

890
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,519
Everything got tied back to Hawaii.

891
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,519
That's how he did it, Graham.

892
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:55,519
Well, the producer, can we see him?

893
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,519
Oh, I'll be happy to.

894
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,519
Greg, sit back for a second.

895
00:32:58,519 --> 00:32:59,519
Oh, yeah.

896
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,519
Well, yeah.

897
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,519
Yeah, yeah.

898
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,519
Oh, yeah, here we go.

899
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:08,519
Here we go.

900
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:09,519
Here we go.

901
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,519
Can we have a little music?

902
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,519
Maybe something that's a little ominous, maybe?

903
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,519
I can't hear you.

904
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,519
Wow.

905
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:15,519
Yes.

906
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,519
Here we go.

907
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:17,519
You can do it to me if I want.

908
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,519
I can do it.

909
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:19,519
Yes.

910
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,519
You're right. Here we go.

911
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,519
Beautiful.

912
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,519
Thank you.

913
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,519
Thank you.

914
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,519
That's a stage smothering.

915
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,519
That's the acid.

916
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,519
It's very impressive, yes.

917
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,519
But that cable...

918
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,519
Yeah, I'm not.

919
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:52,519
Oh, yeah.

920
00:33:52,519 --> 00:33:54,519
It's pregnant.

921
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,519
No, we're having a baby.

922
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,519
I got revel.

923
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:00,519
From there.

924
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:02,519
From that distance.

925
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:03,519
Yes.

926
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,519
Rebels pebble.

927
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,519
It's good.

928
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:06,519
Yeah, it's a little rock.

929
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,519
That's good.

930
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:08,519
That's why you are, bro.

931
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,519
That's why.

932
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:10,519
You have it.

933
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,519
Obviously, you're not just a stand-up.

934
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:13,519
You're like a stand-up superstar.

935
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,519
You sell out of me as all over the world.

936
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:16,519
The best of our time.

937
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,519
Yeah.

938
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:19,519
I think that's a big deal.

939
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:20,519
That's a big deal.

940
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,519
But what's nice to know is...

941
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,519
What's nice to know is...

942
00:34:24,519 --> 00:34:26,519
What's nice to know is...

943
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,519
What's nice to know is...

944
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:30,519
What's nice to know is...

945
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:32,519
What's nice to know is...

946
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,519
It wasn't always like that.

947
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,519
I don't know.

948
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:36,519
They're like...

949
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,519
What did you perform at the seafood festival?

950
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,519
I mean, which show you will know about it?

951
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,519
What was it?

952
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:45,519
At town don't know.

953
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,519
I think they wanted...

954
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,519
Was it crap?

955
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:48,519
I had a crab fest.

956
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:50,519
No, I had a crab fest.

957
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:51,519
A crab fest?

958
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:52,519
What is that?

959
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:54,519
And at the beginning of the stand-up comedy,

960
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:57,519
you're not performing in luxury venues.

961
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:00,519
Wherever they feel that they can build the stage

962
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:02,519
and make money is where you're going.

963
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,519
So there was a crab fest.

964
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,519
We're gonna book some talent.

965
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:09,519
A comedian talent.

966
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:12,519
That was like, oh, you know, I'm available.

967
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,519
I don't know if you guys have ever tried to tell a joke

968
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,519
while people crack in crab.

969
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,519
That's the best environment.

970
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,519
Literally, the frustration that comes

971
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,519
from not being able to open a crab is stupid.

972
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,519
You're not funny at the same time.

973
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:30,519
Enough that you hear.

974
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:32,519
I remember hearing a woman,

975
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,519
older lady who was like, she was cracking crab.

976
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,519
Because this is how you crack crab.

977
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:42,519
You know what I mean? She's like, crack in a crab.

978
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,519
Now, tell a joke and a joke doesn't work.

979
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,519
Now, remember this lady just going, oh, no.

980
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:54,519
I don't think I would much rather be booed.

981
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:58,519
Did this appointment mean it?

982
00:35:58,519 --> 00:36:01,519
From her voice and then she said, baby,

983
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,519
it was like, oh, no, baby.

984
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:08,519
As if I made a mistake with my choice of life.

985
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,519
Like, I'm not going wrong.

986
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:14,519
You know, look, the hardship that I went through

987
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:17,519
has helped build me into the person I am today,

988
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:18,519
where I can take so much.

989
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:20,519
But I've been through it all.

990
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:23,519
I was hitting the face with a buffalo wing.

991
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:26,519
I performed at a catapult.

992
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,519
Don't perform around food for no reason.

993
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,519
I'm going to be going to show you now.

994
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:30,519
There's no food.

995
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:35,519
It was actually a male strip club

996
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,519
that they shut down for comedy for the first half.

997
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:41,519
It was a bunch of ladies in there.

998
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,519
And, you know, it was just supposed to be a performance

999
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,519
for these women that were riled up first day.

1000
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,519
I got on stage when they introduced me.

1001
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,519
And this lady was like, pull it out.

1002
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:52,519
I said, hey, hey.

1003
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,519
That's not me.

1004
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:55,519
I'm not here today.

1005
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,519
I'm here to entertain these dudes.

1006
00:36:58,519 --> 00:37:00,519
I know who's got kids.

1007
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,519
I started trying to emerge into kid material.

1008
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:05,519
And it went due from the back.

1009
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,519
I didn't remember his due from the back.

1010
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,519
He was like, that's enough.

1011
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:11,519
And he just threw a buffalo wing at me.

1012
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:13,519
The man hit me, hit me,

1013
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:14,519
hit me in the cheek,

1014
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:17,519
a little bit of sauce, got like, right here.

1015
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:19,519
Buffalo sauce, hot sauce.

1016
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,519
I assumed it was a woman with a deep voice.

1017
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:23,519
I was like, who threw it?

1018
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:24,519
Who threw it?

1019
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:26,519
Because at the end of the day, I'm a man.

1020
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:28,519
I'm a man first. Don't just expect me.

1021
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,519
He stood up.

1022
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,519
He was like, I did it.

1023
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:33,519
And I contemplated just taking my clothes off.

1024
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:34,519
I was like, I did it.

1025
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:37,519
The only way to do that.

1026
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:40,519
I collect, yeah.

1027
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,519
Well, I collect stuff from movies.

1028
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:44,519
Some of the movies I've done,

1029
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:46,519
but really mainly Star Trek memorabilia.

1030
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:48,519
Because I love Star Trek.

1031
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:50,519
I'm such a nerd.

1032
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,519
Have you ever been in a Star Trek?

1033
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:53,519
No, I've never been in a Star Trek.

1034
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:55,519
But I love the original series.

1035
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,519
So I have the Gorn Head from the original series

1036
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:00,519
from the episode Arena where...

1037
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,519
I think I know.

1038
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:02,519
I know. I'm just...

1039
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,519
That was nothing.

1040
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:04,519
Oh, the Gorn Head.

1041
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,519
Oh, I am.

1042
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,519
He was the owner.

1043
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,519
The Gorn Head, Jack.

1044
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,519
I have...

1045
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,519
I have...

1046
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:10,519
What the...

1047
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:11,519
Is that a Gorn Head?

1048
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:13,519
That's not something you can't even present.

1049
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,519
What the Gorn is?

1050
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,519
The Gorn from Star Trek?

1051
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,519
We're going to give you the Gorn Head.

1052
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:19,519
Oh, wow.

1053
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
Do you have any of the Boulders?

1054
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,519
Do you have any of the Boulders?

1055
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:22,519
I don't have any of the light Boulders.

1056
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:23,519
I don't have a paper mache.

1057
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:25,519
No, but I have Spock's ears from...

1058
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:26,519
Oh, they actually...

1059
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:27,519
They are.

1060
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,519
Yeah, they're working.

1061
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:29,519
They're working.

1062
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:30,519
Yeah, very good.

1063
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:31,519
But on Brightsmaids,

1064
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,519
you did do a lot of proper bum-ding on Brightsmaids.

1065
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,519
Did you like party nights and stuff?

1066
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,519
We did a pre...

1067
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:39,519
Press a pre.

1068
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:41,519
The My Co-Writer, Annie and I had the idea

1069
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,519
to get all the girls together

1070
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,519
plus the script supervisor, Wardrobe,

1071
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:46,519
like the women on the film,

1072
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,519
to Bought 40.

1073
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,519
There were a lot of people.

1074
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:49,519
40 women.

1075
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,519
It was pitched to me as research

1076
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:54,519
because initially there was a scene

1077
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:57,519
where we went to a gentleman's entertainment...

1078
00:38:57,519 --> 00:38:59,519
Yeah, parlor.

1079
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:02,519
A strip, a guy's strip of...

1080
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:03,519
A guy's strip club.

1081
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,519
Yeah, okay.

1082
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:06,519
So we got in a party bus

1083
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,519
with a lot of...

1084
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:11,519
A lot of booze, weird poles,

1085
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,519
which I was thinking...

1086
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:14,519
Did it have the disco lights in the bus?

1087
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:15,519
Oh, yeah.

1088
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:16,519
Oh, fabulous.

1089
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,519
Yeah, and then we went to...

1090
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,519
We went to a strip club.

1091
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:21,519
And...

1092
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:22,519
They did watch the show.

1093
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:23,519
They did Vignettes.

1094
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,519
They did Vignettes.

1095
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:25,519
It was not a back draft.

1096
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:26,519
Yeah, it wasn't that...

1097
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:28,519
It would all come out and like...

1098
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,519
Fire mid stuff and then it was like...

1099
00:39:30,519 --> 00:39:31,519
Well, like everything had the same theme

1100
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:32,519
and everything involved.

1101
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,519
I seemed like every number had a duster.

1102
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,519
They had a long trench coat to the floor.

1103
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,519
A lot of equipment.

1104
00:39:38,519 --> 00:39:39,519
But they did do...

1105
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,519
Do you remember the Matrix one?

1106
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:42,519
The Matrix one, yeah.

1107
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,519
Yeah, there was...

1108
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,519
Somebody was playing Neo.

1109
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:45,519
Wonderful.

1110
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,519
There was a lot of long trenches

1111
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:49,519
and guys and suits

1112
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:51,519
and everybody had these very cheap glasses on.

1113
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:52,519
But I couldn't figure out the...

1114
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,519
One guy had a huge, huge thick rope around his waist.

1115
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,519
And I was like...

1116
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:00,519
I have not seen the Matrix in a while.

1117
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:01,519
I couldn't figure out...

1118
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,519
We were all like...

1119
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,519
What's the rope about?

1120
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:06,519
I don't remember a rope in the Matrix.

1121
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,519
And they're like...

1122
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:08,519
Do the synchronized dancing.

1123
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,519
It's like all this are closes coming off.

1124
00:40:10,519 --> 00:40:11,519
We're like...

1125
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:13,519
I mean, on and on.

1126
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,519
I'm just like...

1127
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,519
I don't get what the rope is about.

1128
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:17,519
And then the big move comes where, you know,

1129
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:19,519
the bullets come and he does the back bend.

1130
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,519
Clearly, this professional dancer could not do a back bend.

1131
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,519
So the big move was like...

1132
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:26,519
All of a sudden it's like...

1133
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,519
And somebody offstage is clearly holding the rope.

1134
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:34,519
And it's clearly...

1135
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,519
Now I can say...

1136
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,519
He's like...

1137
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,519
He's like...

1138
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:39,519
He's like...

1139
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,519
He's like...

1140
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:41,519
No!

1141
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:43,519
And that was like...

1142
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:45,519
That was like a stand-up model.

1143
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:46,519
A lot of themes.

1144
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:47,519
A lot of themes.

1145
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,519
And now, Saturday Night Live also was a big bonding thing.

1146
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:52,519
Now, because...

1147
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,519
Do you know Leslie and...

1148
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,519
Kate...

1149
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,519
Kate...

1150
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:57,519
Kate...

1151
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:58,519
Kate...

1152
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,519
We met...

1153
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,519
I think we met when I hosted...

1154
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:03,519
Oh, no.

1155
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:04,519
And we did a movie together.

1156
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:06,519
And we worked together after that.

1157
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:07,519
Okay, yeah.

1158
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,519
Okay.

1159
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:11,519
But now, you guys are still in, like, most people I'm sure know,

1160
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:14,519
but it's a big comedy sketch show in America.

1161
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,519
But how long have you worked together for how many years now?

1162
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:19,519
It's been two...

1163
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,519
After one.

1164
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,519
Right?

1165
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:22,519
It's been three?

1166
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:23,519
Maybe three.

1167
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:24,519
It's been three.

1168
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,519
The first year, Leslie...

1169
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,519
My name is Kate McKinnon and she...

1170
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,519
I know that.

1171
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:33,519
But she came up to me and she said...

1172
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:36,519
After a year of knowing me...

1173
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:40,519
You all right, Kate Middleton?

1174
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,519
Oh, my God.

1175
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:47,519
And were you joking?

1176
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,519
No, I was not.

1177
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:51,519
And I was like, my kid.

1178
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:53,519
I was like, whoa, who's Middleton then?

1179
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,519
She's like a princess bitch?

1180
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,519
I was like...

1181
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:01,519
I like her, baby.

1182
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,519
I like Kate Middleton.

1183
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,519
Oh, her hair is awesome.

1184
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,519
And Kate, you did some great characters on Silent Live.

1185
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,519
You're Justin Bieber.

1186
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:11,519
You are.

1187
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,519
Justin Bieber is spookly accurate.

1188
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:15,519
Thank you so much.

1189
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,519
That is incredible.

1190
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:17,519
Thank you so much.

1191
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:18,519
And did you...

1192
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,519
You've done it in front of him, haven't you?

1193
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,519
I have not.

1194
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:21,519
We haven't.

1195
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,519
I haven't.

1196
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:24,519
I have not breached.

1197
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,519
I met him before because he hosted SNL once.

1198
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:30,519
And then that was before I started doing the pression of him.

1199
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,519
But I was so struck by how...

1200
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:35,519
This was before he got really beefy for those Calvin Klein ants.

1201
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:38,519
And now he looks like, you know, a big beefcake.

1202
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,519
But he was really...

1203
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:44,519
He was very delicate and he very tender, beautiful, just up such a beautiful face.

1204
00:42:44,519 --> 00:42:47,519
And such a big, big hat.

1205
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:49,519
Such a big clothes.

1206
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:50,519
And just the most beautiful.

1207
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:53,519
And I am a huge fan of his and I love it.

1208
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,519
And now, you have a special way of...

1209
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,519
A special way of preparing the face, haven't you?

1210
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,519
Yes.

1211
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:04,519
Yes, you want to look as though you've done something wrong, but like...

1212
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:05,519
Yes, you do.

1213
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,519
LAUGHTER

1214
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:20,519
That is very good.

1215
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:22,519
How old are you now?

1216
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,519
I'm 77.

1217
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:25,519
And I...

1218
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,519
I don't...

1219
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:28,519
I don't...

1220
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,519
Don't...

1221
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:30,519
That is...

1222
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:32,519
Oh, that...

1223
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:33,519
I want to be a floc.

1224
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,519
Say, you know, they're going to live longer than me.

1225
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,519
You have to go, oh...

1226
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,519
In New York, they floc.

1227
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,519
I mean, it's a new apartment on the market, too.

1228
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:46,519
I hate when people say, like, oh, there's 77 years young.

1229
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:48,519
I met Vanessa...

1230
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:49,519
Vanessa Feltz.

1231
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:50,519
Oh, yeah.

1232
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:52,519
And she said to me, he has, Joan, she's 77 years young.

1233
00:43:52,519 --> 00:43:55,519
And I want to say, and he has Vanessa and she's 350 pounds thin.

1234
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,519
LAUGHTER

1235
00:43:57,519 --> 00:43:59,519
Oh, my God.

1236
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:01,519
LAUGHTER

1237
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,519
She has...

1238
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:05,519
Yeah.

1239
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:06,519
So...

1240
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,519
Age...

1241
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,519
Age sucks.

1242
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,519
And you have to face it.

1243
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:12,519
And you have these...

1244
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,519
I've been on this show with some of these older women

1245
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,519
that still try to look good.

1246
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:19,519
No name, it's Goldie Han.

1247
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:21,519
LAUGHTER

1248
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:24,519
She's my friend, and she says to me,

1249
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,519
would you believe I got a grown-up daughter?

1250
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,519
And you go, yes!

1251
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:29,519
LAUGHTER

1252
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,519
And the lowest skirt, your nipples are showing.

1253
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,519
LAUGHTER

1254
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,519
There goes the Goldie Han booking.

1255
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:39,519
LAUGHTER

1256
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,519
No, age sucks, so you got a face.

1257
00:44:43,519 --> 00:44:47,519
But is it because America is really so youth obsessed?

1258
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:48,519
I mean, how?

1259
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,519
And in the film, you show, you know, kind of...

1260
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:54,519
That it is hard for a woman of your age to get the job.

1261
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:56,519
It's beyond difficult.

1262
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:58,519
The only jobs really left now for women,

1263
00:44:58,519 --> 00:45:01,519
unless they get friendly with people to do films.

1264
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:03,519
LAUGHTER

1265
00:45:03,519 --> 00:45:06,519
The only jobs that are really commercials.

1266
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:08,519
I just thank God, I made my...

1267
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:10,519
...early not this year on a...

1268
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:13,519
a practical girlie, which is for Driver-Gyna.

1269
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:14,519
And it's...

1270
00:45:14,519 --> 00:45:15,519
LAUGHTER

1271
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:16,519
It may be.

1272
00:45:16,519 --> 00:45:20,519
Well, anyone knows the heartbreak of Driver-Gyna.

1273
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,519
LAUGHTER

1274
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,519
I was...

1275
00:45:24,519 --> 00:45:26,519
LAUGHTER

1276
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,519
I was perfect for it.

1277
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:30,519
I...

1278
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,519
Kattles follow me home.

1279
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,519
LAUGHTER

1280
00:45:34,519 --> 00:45:36,519
LAUGHTER

1281
00:45:36,519 --> 00:45:38,519
LAUGHTER

1282
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:42,519
Three Jewish men are trying to rent my uterus

1283
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,519
instead of going to Miami.

1284
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:46,519
LAUGHTER

1285
00:45:46,519 --> 00:45:48,519
LAUGHTER

1286
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,519
LAUGHTER

1287
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:51,519
But...

1288
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:53,519
And there's...

1289
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,519
Thank God for these commercials.

1290
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,519
There's one called...

1291
00:45:57,519 --> 00:45:59,519
A Zestra.

1292
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:00,519
Is that coming in yet?

1293
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:03,519
LAUGHTER

1294
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,519
It's like women's...

1295
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:07,519
Viagra has done happening yet.

1296
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,519
It's women's Viagra.

1297
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:11,519
And they have a big discussion with me.

1298
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:13,519
Should they make it in pill form?

1299
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:15,519
This is honest to God, truth.

1300
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:18,519
They're in pill form or cream.

1301
00:46:18,519 --> 00:46:20,519
Because they didn't know which...

1302
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:22,519
And they find a side of these idiots

1303
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:25,519
will do it in cream because if it's in pill form

1304
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,519
in a bar, a man can drop it in a woman's drink.

1305
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:29,519
And she won't know it.

1306
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:31,519
But if you're in a bar and a guy goes,

1307
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:33,519
so where you from?

1308
00:46:33,519 --> 00:46:35,519
LAUGHTER

1309
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,519
LAUGHTER

1310
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,519
LAUGHTER

1311
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:41,519
LAUGHTER

1312
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:43,519
So, I'm...

1313
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:44,519
I love...

1314
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:45,519
I love for that.

1315
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:46,519
I can wear a show too.

1316
00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:49,519
LAUGHTER

1317
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:50,519
We do another thing.

1318
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,519
We loved you as the Dini in a lap.

1319
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:53,519
Oh, that was fun.

1320
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:55,519
So, we thought we might have our very own

1321
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:57,519
Genie on the show tonight.

1322
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:59,519
So, is there anyone in the audience

1323
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,519
who fancies a go at being a Genie?

1324
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,519
Oh, look at them. They do.

1325
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:04,519
OK, try you.

1326
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:05,519
What...what's your name?

1327
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:06,519
Yewren.

1328
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:07,519
Sorry, what?

1329
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,519
Yewren.

1330
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:09,519
Yewren.

1331
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:11,519
This name is Yewren.

1332
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:13,519
Yewren.

1333
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:14,519
Nice to have you here.

1334
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:15,519
Nice to have you here.

1335
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:16,519
No, no worries.

1336
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,519
Can I hear you a little too late?

1337
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,519
You start frightening.

1338
00:47:20,519 --> 00:47:21,519
Oh, no.

1339
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:22,519
Don't piss off Yewren.

1340
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:23,519
OK, so Yewren.

1341
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,519
Don't think of a magic word.

1342
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:27,519
Right? Something, you know, it's just you, magic word.

1343
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,519
And that camera three is going to do a kind of Zoom crash on you.

1344
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:32,519
So, when I say go, you...

1345
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:34,519
And you'll just do your magic word.

1346
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,519
OK, so, Yewren, go.

1347
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,519
Hi, Graham.

1348
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,519
LAUGHTER

1349
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,519
Wow.

1350
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:52,519
How Graham I feel like we're in the middle of a telephone right now.

1351
00:47:52,519 --> 00:47:56,519
Yewren has learned to say hi, Graham. Thanks to your dollars.

1352
00:47:56,519 --> 00:47:57,519
Please help.

1353
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,519
You'll learn another phrase by the end of the show.

1354
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,519
Do you...

1355
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:04,519
Should we try another boy?

1356
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:07,519
Oh, actually, you're wearing blue already.

1357
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:08,519
Yeah? OK.

1358
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,519
So, into that camera, you're magic word. What's your name?

1359
00:48:10,519 --> 00:48:11,519
Nick.

1360
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,519
Good Nick. OK.

1361
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,519
A fan of Yewren.

1362
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:17,519
OK, Nick.

1363
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,519
Number three, and go.

1364
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,519
Alicazam.

1365
00:48:22,519 --> 00:48:24,519
Wow.

1366
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,519
It was almost...it was almost two words.

1367
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:32,519
It was a bit like...

1368
00:48:32,519 --> 00:48:34,519
You're very good at that.

1369
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:36,519
Yeah. Alicazam.

1370
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:39,519
Time to dance now.

1371
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,519
I'm going to dance with you and...

1372
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,519
And, good Nick.

1373
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,519
I'm Alicazam.

1374
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:48,519
Jazz hands, jazz hands, jazz at all.

1375
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:50,519
We're going to go, good Nick.

1376
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:54,519
Good Nick, go.

1377
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,519
OK, go, go, go. Follow the follow-up.

1378
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:03,519
So, I'm just going to get my jeanie to help me.

1379
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:04,519
OK, hang on.

1380
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:05,519
Oh, yes.

1381
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:06,519
I'm going to go back for creature.

1382
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:07,519
LAMER.

1383
00:49:08,519 --> 00:49:10,519
OK, come on, Nick.

1384
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:11,519
Good Nick.

1385
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:12,519
Oh, there he is.

1386
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:13,519
Yes!

1387
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:14,519
OK, Nick.

1388
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:15,519
OK, Nick.

1389
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,519
Ready?

1390
00:49:16,519 --> 00:49:17,519
I need...

1391
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:20,519
I need a lovely funky DJ console, please.

1392
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:22,519
Alicazam.

1393
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:23,519
Alicazam.

1394
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:24,519
Good luck, man.

1395
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:26,519
Ladies and gentlemen.

1396
00:49:26,519 --> 00:49:28,519
Good work. Good work, Nick.

1397
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:32,519
OK, I'll tell you what. Nick, you can come back into the studio.

1398
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:34,519
Come back to the studio and help us in this thing.

1399
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:35,519
Well done.

1400
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,519
LAUGHTER

1401
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,519
That's fucking losing.

1402
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,519
That's that.

1403
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,519
That was so great.

1404
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,519
Yeah, right, I'm not exploding anymore. Thank you.

1405
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:48,519
OK, we got to get into the DJ booth. Right, here we go.

1406
00:49:48,519 --> 00:49:50,519
Here we go. It's the Robin and Graham Road show.

1407
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,519
Hello, sir.

1408
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:52,519
All of the clubs.

1409
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:53,519
OK, you go over there and I'm well done.

1410
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,519
So, there's a mic there.

1411
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,519
Then Nick.

1412
00:49:56,519 --> 00:49:57,519
Well, what's the music?

1413
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:58,519
Nick, we're the shoutout right now.

1414
00:49:58,519 --> 00:49:59,519
Nick, we're not full of blue people.

1415
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:00,519
Nick, go, keep it real.

1416
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:02,519
Get ready for an Alicazam.

1417
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:03,519
Alicazam.

1418
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:04,519
Yeah!

1419
00:50:04,519 --> 00:50:05,519
Very good.

1420
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:06,519
You hear that?

1421
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:08,519
Now, I don't have any jingles on it.

1422
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:10,519
So, it's the Robin and Graham Road show.

1423
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:12,519
Could you do a jingle, a live jingle for it?

1424
00:50:12,519 --> 00:50:17,519
Welcome to the Robin and Graham, ready, y'all shall...

1425
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:19,519
Nice to meet you.

1426
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,519
Very good.

1427
00:50:20,519 --> 00:50:22,519
Let's back with a big shoutout from Nick.

1428
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,519
OK, let's sit at Sunset, so-so here. Good evening, Robin.

1429
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:28,519
Good evening, Graham. Welcome back.

1430
00:50:28,519 --> 00:50:29,519
Once again, we got some shoutouts.

1431
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:32,519
I got one going out right now to Steven Buck.

1432
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:35,519
He wants a shoutout to Jess, who's a best friend, and he says,

1433
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,519
Stop texting him. He's not interested.

1434
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:39,519
Yeah!

1435
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:42,519
You're listening to the Robin and Graham Road show.

1436
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:43,519
Alicazam.

1437
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:45,519
No, you're ticked the jingle.

1438
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:51,519
Welcome to the Robin and Graham, ready, y'all shall...

1439
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:53,519
Where's the whisper shoutout?

1440
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:54,519
The whisper shoutout.

1441
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:55,519
The whisper shoutout.

1442
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:56,519
The whisper shoutout.

1443
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:57,519
What's the shoutout to Esther, best friend?

1444
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,519
That bloke you pulled, don't worry about Toinder Remember's name.

1445
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,519
You can do so much better.

1446
00:51:02,519 --> 00:51:04,519
Yow!

1447
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,519
Whoa!

1448
00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:08,519
Where's Martin?

1449
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:09,519
Marlon?

1450
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:11,519
There he is, as Marlon.

1451
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,519
Very well going to say, we'd like to shout out to his friend, Greg War.

1452
00:51:14,519 --> 00:51:17,519
Don't worry, girls love that you have got a third nipple.

1453
00:51:17,519 --> 00:51:18,519
Woo!

1454
00:51:18,519 --> 00:51:19,519
Oh!

1455
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,519
Three nipples, ABC way to go.

1456
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,519
Show it!

1457
00:51:24,519 --> 00:51:25,519
Show it!

1458
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,519
Shep's off!

1459
00:51:26,519 --> 00:51:27,519
Show the nipple!

1460
00:51:27,519 --> 00:51:28,519
Oh!

1461
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:29,519
Greg!

1462
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,519
Oh!

1463
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,519
Come on, little Newton boy!

1464
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:33,519
What?

1465
00:51:33,519 --> 00:51:34,519
Well!

1466
00:51:34,519 --> 00:51:36,519
How many times have you?

1467
00:51:36,519 --> 00:51:38,519
You don't have two!

1468
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:39,519
Oh!

1469
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:40,519
Go, little nipple.

1470
00:51:40,519 --> 00:51:42,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1471
00:51:42,519 --> 00:51:44,519
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1472
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,519
Yes.

1473
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:46,519
First of all, I'm not a circus freak.

1474
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:48,519
I'm just kidding.

1475
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:51,519
Secondly, I will get my third nipple out on the condition

1476
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:53,519
that Robin Williams comes and touches it.

1477
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:55,519
Well!

1478
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,519
There we go!

1479
00:51:57,519 --> 00:51:58,519
Oh!

1480
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,519
There we go!

1481
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:00,519
Oh!

1482
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,519
There we go!

1483
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,519
Oh!

1484
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:04,519
Oh!

1485
00:52:04,519 --> 00:52:05,519
Oh!

1486
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:06,519
Oh!

1487
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:07,519
Oh!

1488
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:09,519
This better be a real nipple.

1489
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:10,519
All right, ready?

1490
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:11,519
Here we go, ready?

1491
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:12,519
Ready?

1492
00:52:12,519 --> 00:52:13,519
Let's see.

1493
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:16,519
Oh, please, please let it be a nipple.

1494
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:19,519
I have a third ball, too.

1495
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:20,519
Ready, ready?

1496
00:52:20,519 --> 00:52:21,519
Here we go.

1497
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:22,519
Oh!

1498
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:23,519
Oh!

1499
00:52:24,519 --> 00:52:25,519
I did.

1500
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,519
Oh!

1501
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:28,519
Wow!

1502
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,519
Wow!

1503
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:30,519
Wow!

1504
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:31,519
Wow!

1505
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:33,519
Round of on.

1506
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:35,519
Six really did that.

1507
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,519
I like that, man.

1508
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:37,519
Just like that, the thumb girl is going,

1509
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:39,519
you've got another one.

1510
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:41,519
Play with my third nipple girl.

1511
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:44,519
You've never had fun till you go third.

1512
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:46,519
Once you've touched a third nipple,

1513
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,519
things get crazy.

1514
00:52:48,519 --> 00:52:50,519
I get two nipples going, but when the third goes,

1515
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:51,519
mmm!

1516
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:55,519
The third nipple goes and then my fourth penis jumps out.

1517
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:57,519
I'm like, mmm!

1518
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,519
There is a gentleman, please, that I guess,

1519
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:04,519
to like the fantastic Mr. Robin Williams.

1520
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,519
Oh!

1521
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:06,519
Oh!

1522
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:07,519
Oh!

1523
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:08,519
Oh!

1524
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,519
Oh!

1525
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,519
Oh!

1526
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:11,519
Oh!

1527
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:12,519
Oh!

1528
00:53:12,519 --> 00:53:13,519
Oh!

1529
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:14,519
Oh!

1530
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:15,519
Oh!

1531
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:16,519
Oh!

1532
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:17,519
Oh!

1533
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:18,519
Where does it?

1534
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:20,519
What would you now?

1535
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:21,519
Surrapaptic, sir.

1536
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:23,519
And you don't really use the surrmuch, do you?

1537
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:24,519
Umm...

1538
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:26,519
What should I...

1539
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:28,519
Sorry, should I have been calling you...

1540
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:29,519
No, I shouldn't.

1541
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:30,519
Am I supposed to?

1542
00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:31,519
No!

1543
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,519
Okay.

1544
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:33,519
But do you...

1545
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:34,519
No.

1546
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:35,519
I take my lead from Sir Ian,

1547
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:37,519
whom we've both shared some time with.

1548
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:38,519
Yes.

1549
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,519
And he is...

1550
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,519
He is so...

1551
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,519
...flegmatic about all of that.

1552
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:44,519
And I just...

1553
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:46,519
You know, it's a great honour,

1554
00:53:46,519 --> 00:53:48,519
to help something that I need to press.

1555
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:51,519
When you bump into another sir, when you're writing about...

1556
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:52,519
Do you then...

1557
00:53:52,519 --> 00:53:53,519
Do you...

1558
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:54,519
Do you pull...

1559
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:55,519
A few...

1560
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:58,519
Well, you must roll in surr circles.

1561
00:53:58,519 --> 00:53:59,519
Okay.

1562
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:00,519
Circles.

1563
00:54:00,519 --> 00:54:02,519
Oh, sir.

1564
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:03,519
Oh, sir.

1565
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,519
I just...

1566
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:05,519
Oh, I just...

1567
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:06,519
I just opened it.

1568
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:07,519
Yeah.

1569
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:08,519
For just a minute.

1570
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,519
That was my answer.

1571
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:10,519
That was my answer.

1572
00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:11,519
I heard it.

1573
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:13,519
Can I read the ignorant American in the ass?

1574
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:15,519
So, how do you become a sir?

1575
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:16,519
Well...

1576
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:17,519
A Patrick?

1577
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:18,519
How?

1578
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:21,519
Well, you know, it's a case of...

1579
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,519
...a long day.

1580
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:25,519
No, no, no.

1581
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,519
I got mine on the Queen's Birthday Honours.

1582
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,519
But you have reminded me that I did have a sir encounter.

1583
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:37,519
Only a few weeks ago in Los Angeles.

1584
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:39,519
A rather fancy...

1585
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:41,519
In fact, extremely fancy restaurant.

1586
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:43,519
Tell them what it is, they'll know.

1587
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:47,519
It was the Tower Bar.

1588
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:49,519
Some sort of tower?

1589
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,519
No.

1590
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,519
No, yeah, guys.

1591
00:54:52,519 --> 00:54:53,519
The Queen.

1592
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:54,519
No, no, no.

1593
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:55,519
Sit down.

1594
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:56,519
The Tower Bar.

1595
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:57,519
Oh, man, it's a...

1596
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:58,519
Oh, Europa.

1597
00:54:58,519 --> 00:55:00,519
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1598
00:55:00,519 --> 00:55:01,519
What?

1599
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:02,519
It's a...

1600
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:04,519
It's a Tower Bar.

1601
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:06,519
Yeah!

1602
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:08,519
Oh, my goodness.

1603
00:55:08,519 --> 00:55:10,519
It's a little narrow.

1604
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:12,519
Oh, no!

1605
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:16,519
Keep going.

1606
00:55:16,519 --> 00:55:17,519
Okay.

1607
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:19,519
Well, not a Tower Bar, it is a spot.

1608
00:55:19,519 --> 00:55:21,519
I got a feeling this isn't going to work out.

1609
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:23,519
It's a spot.

1610
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:27,519
So, we had four of us were seated at a table,

1611
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:32,519
about 15 minutes later, into the restaurant walks Sir Paul McCartney.

1612
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:33,519
Wow.

1613
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:38,519
Now, Paul and I have a very slender relationship,

1614
00:55:38,519 --> 00:55:41,519
but it lasted decades.

1615
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,519
I first encountered him in 1964.

1616
00:55:46,519 --> 00:55:47,519
No.

1617
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:54,519
When his girlfriend, Jane Asher, then, told him that I loved Aston Martin's.

1618
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,519
I was driving a battered old Ford,

1619
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,519
but Aston Martin's were my dream car.

1620
00:55:58,519 --> 00:55:59,519
She told him this.

1621
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,519
And one night, we knew he was seeing the show.

1622
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:03,519
There was a knock on my door.

1623
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:04,519
And I said, yeah, come in.

1624
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:05,519
I'm there in my underwear.

1625
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:07,519
As usual.

1626
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:09,519
I was a great people.

1627
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,519
I hang around, that just in the hope.

1628
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:13,519
I'm in.

1629
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:14,519
I'm in my pants.

1630
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,519
Yes.

1631
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:17,519
I'm ready for you.

1632
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:19,519
I'm ready for you.

1633
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:20,519
Come in.

1634
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:23,519
And the door opened, standing there was Paul McCartney,

1635
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:24,519
who I had never met before.

1636
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:26,519
And this was 1964.

1637
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:30,519
And he said, Jane says that you like Aston Martin's here.

1638
00:56:30,519 --> 00:56:31,519
Drive this.

1639
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:32,519
Wow.

1640
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:34,519
And he tossed a bunch of keys off the table.

1641
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:35,519
And it was an ass.

1642
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:36,519
It was his.

1643
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:37,519
He threw.

1644
00:56:37,519 --> 00:56:38,519
He threw.

1645
00:56:38,519 --> 00:56:40,519
Anyway, you want to hear the rest of the car?

1646
00:56:40,519 --> 00:56:41,519
Keep going.

1647
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:44,519
We're in the fanciest restaurant in LA.

1648
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:45,519
We're now in the Tower Bar.

1649
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:46,519
Tower Bar?

1650
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:47,519
Oh.

1651
00:56:47,519 --> 00:56:49,519
Oh my god.

1652
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:50,519
Oh.

1653
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,519
Oh.

1654
00:56:52,519 --> 00:56:54,519
It's a legend.

1655
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:59,519
I am feeling less, less good.

1656
00:56:59,519 --> 00:57:00,519
Keep going.

1657
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,519
Keep going.

1658
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:02,519
You're in there.

1659
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,519
The Paul McCartney's coming.

1660
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:04,519
I'm ready.

1661
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:05,519
I'm ready.

1662
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:06,519
I'm ready.

1663
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:07,519
I'm ready.

1664
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:08,519
He's in the 60s.

1665
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:10,519
And he sees me and comes over andhil I stand up and say hi.

1666
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:12,519
And we have a big hug in the restaurant.

1667
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:16,519
And I'm very much aware that there's all the tables are full on this kind of thing.

1668
00:57:16,519 --> 00:57:20,519
And we talk for five or six minutes and he goes and sits down.

1669
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:25,519
Five minutes go by and into the restaurant walks a ringo star.

1670
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:26,519
I swear to you.

1671
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:27,519
I'm not picking this up.

1672
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:28,519
What were they together?

1673
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:29,519
They were.

1674
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,519
Oh, they were at the same table.

1675
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:32,519
Well, they were the same.

1676
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:33,519
Yes.

1677
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:37,519
Well, we were at the Tower of Bartholomew.

1678
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:38,519
At Tower of Bartholomew.

1679
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:44,519
I am expecting so many free meals.

1680
00:57:44,519 --> 00:57:51,519
And we finish early and I get up to go and Paul stands up to say goodbye and we have a hug.

1681
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:52,519
And this we have a hug.

1682
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:56,519
He says into my ear, do you know a ringo?

1683
00:57:56,519 --> 00:57:59,519
I said, yeah, of course.

1684
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:00,519
I've never met him but I'm.

1685
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,519
He said, oh, boy, ringo, come on, come over here.

1686
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,519
Hang on a minute.

1687
00:58:04,519 --> 00:58:09,519
He said, sir, ringo, sir, Patrick, sir, Paul.

1688
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,519
Hey, we've got the Knights of the Round Table.

1689
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:13,519
He's right.

1690
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:14,519
He got that.

1691
00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:15,519
Yeah, he got that.

1692
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:16,519
He got that.

1693
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:17,519
Yeah.

1694
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:18,519
He got that.

1695
00:58:18,519 --> 00:58:19,519
Yeah.
