1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
My lesbian friends bought me a gold timepiece for my birthday.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
I think they got confused when I said I want to watch.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hey guys.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
He was there!

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Okay.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
How are you?

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm good, how are you?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You look drunk.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm fine, I don't know what you're talking about.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yeah.

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm a slut.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Alright, alright, alright.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's get this over and die with.

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What does everyone seem to want to rush through these segments of me?

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay, anyway.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is it a weed or a weed?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Don't buy you a lip at me.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
That's it.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Let's go and see what this is.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
See if this paper rock.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
See if this paper rock.

23
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let me fast you.

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Okay, so I haven't seen any of these jokes.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I got to punch my friends to write them down.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So let's see how this goes.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Okay.

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A little envelope.

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It feels like we're about to find out a prize.

30
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This could go anyway.

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what these...

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm very scared.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You look nervous just from the first line.

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What's the difference between a Catholic priest and a pimple?

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What?

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
At least the pimple waits until you're a teenager before it comes on your face.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
That's the first one.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That's all off, my god.

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Ugh.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
That's bad.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
So, funnily enough, I am going to be using all replies to my story from the fans.

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
From the fans.

43
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
They're going to shit.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Wait, I didn't answer.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Some of these are actually very good.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Ugh.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What's the difference between a rusty bus stop and a crab with a boob job?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I can't see the bus stop.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
A crab with a boob job is so funny.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm just not interested in this.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Are you ready?

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It was a little crab with a boob job.

53
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So, I really want to know, are you thinking of Sebastian?

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Tell me the fucking joke.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I would love to, but I can't actually see the punch line.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So...

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh my god.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I think once a cross...

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
No, wait, once a crusty...

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Wait, once a...

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I know it.

62
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Once a crusty bus station and once a busty crustacean.

63
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
That's good.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
When you were thinking about the crab with a boob job,

65
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
were you thinking of Sebastian from the little mermaid?

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No, I was thinking of a little crab with big yellow titties,

67
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
like scurrying across the beach.

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's like jiggling around.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You look like two shops in here, my god.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's so funny.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's put it in there.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Come on.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ma...

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We all know you like to cheat, but can you at least think?

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Yeah.

76
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh.

77
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
My lesbian friends bought me a gold timepiece for my birthday.

78
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I think they got confused when I said, I want to watch.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That's pretty good.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's really good.

81
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I love it.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We're seeing this together for the first.

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's great.

85
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't make so funny than you.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How does that feel?

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Shut up.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Come on.

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just...

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you call the assistant to...

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Okay.

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What do you...

93
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What do you call the assistant to the assistant, Nutt?

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What?

95
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A cocoa nut.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
These are not mine.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thanks.

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thanks.

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They're not mine. They're the fans.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're delivering.

101
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Nice jacket.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Today, Junior.

103
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What do you call an artist with a brown finger?

104
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
What?

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Pick a asshole.

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
That's good. That's a good one.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What happened?

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Oh, it's funny.

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
He's a good one. He's a good one.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Genuinely, your friends are very funny.

111
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll hook you up with one.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Okay.

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Oh, so...

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's very great.

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I had it.

116
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You should have TV TV.

117
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, it's...

118
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm afraid.

119
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm from his own friends.

120
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Dogs can't operate MRI.

121
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, y'all miss that.

122
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He was just staring straight at my boots.

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Stop killing that.

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Someone get mad some water for God's sake.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm scared.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm scared.

127
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm scared.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Stop talking to someone.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you okay?

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He was so loud around.

131
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is good content. Keep going.

132
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Happy to slap you one time.

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yeah, give me a slap.

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, slap you.

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No, because knowing him will just get off on it.

136
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And I don't want to give him that.

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh, he's okay.

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I can't do this.

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can't do this.

140
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Have you finished your job?

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't. I sat at the level that the woman finished.

142
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Go on.

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you like this one?

144
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What do you call an Afghan virgin?

145
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Never been laid on.

147
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That's pretty good.

148
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Not at all.

149
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
How do you embarrass an archaeologist?

150
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yeah.

151
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hand them a used tampon and ask them what period it's from.

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Ah, it's gross.

153
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Why does the Easter Bunny hide his Easter eggs?

154
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why?

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
He doesn't want anyone knowing he fucks chickens.

156
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Man, what did you say?

157
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't remember what you said.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,060
He будет I am certain that there's a way to describe the your

159
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,060
mind.

160
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,800
Mission end.

161
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,639
I hope he does this for a moment.

162
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:06,439
Five lanterns and aまあuf.

163
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,959
He says he's got matchingess now.

164
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,039
difference between male and female guys.

165
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:11,039
What?

166
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
Boo-bees.

167
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,039
There you are.

168
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,039
That sounds like cheese.

169
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,039
Boo-bees.

170
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:20,039
That's funny.

171
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,039
Oh.

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,039
Oh.

173
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,039
Oh.

174
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,039
Oh.

175
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:25,039
What's the score?

176
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,039
Fuck.

177
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:27,039
Fuck.

178
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,039
I'm going to try.

179
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:29,039
I'm going to try now.

180
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,039
Mind you, I'm already quite tipsy.

181
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,039
So the fact that I'm no laughing is really concerning.

182
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:33,039
Go on.

183
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,039
What do I show you?

184
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,039
I'm going to show you.

185
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,039
I'm going to show you.

186
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,040
What do I show you?

187
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Fuck, sorry.

188
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Third time's a charm.

189
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Come on, baby.

190
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,040
You got this.

191
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,040
What do I show you?

192
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,040
Gain ecologist and a puppy having comment?

193
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
How did you fuck that up so badly?

194
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,040
What?

195
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
A wet nose.

196
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,040
That's pretty funny.

197
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,040
That's great.

198
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,040
This is so much fun.

199
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Yeah, I really enjoy this.

200
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
I don't know where they're going.

201
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Okay.

202
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Oh, God.

203
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,879
Okay.

204
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Oh God.

205
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Why?

206
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,840
Excuse me.

207
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,000
I have a drink.

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,840
Okay.

209
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Mmm, ruffies.

210
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,800
So you're just saying,

211
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,560
say, ruffies or ruffies.

212
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Shut up and drink it.

213
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,520
Finish it off, finish it off.

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,360
Oh.

215
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,200
What's brown and sticky?

216
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,000
Ungudanesh.

217
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You know what else?

218
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,839
What else?

219
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,000
My Rihanna poster.

220
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,480
That was a fan submitted one.

221
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,719
I didn't know where that was going.

222
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:44,719
I'll give you another one.

223
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,240
I need a drink.

224
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,439
Watch this comeback.

225
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:49,439
Watch me win this.

226
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,199
I bought a box of condoms earlier today.

227
00:08:56,199 --> 00:08:58,839
The cashier asked if I'd like a paper bag.

228
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,679
I said, no, I'll just turn off the lights.

229
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,039
Yeah.

230
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:08,159
Hasn't happened to me.

231
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,719
I'm assuming it happens to you quite a bit.

232
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:11,719
Yeah.

233
00:09:11,719 --> 00:09:12,719
No.

234
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,559
All right.

235
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:18,799
Oh God.

236
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,319
Sorry.

237
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,519
What's that?

238
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,679
I will hurt you.

239
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,679
You did that.

240
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:24,679
I'm sorry.

241
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,679
How did that really take?

242
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:27,679
I'm sorry.

243
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:28,679
What?

244
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,679
I'm sorry.

245
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,679
I'm sorry.

246
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,679
I'm sorry.

247
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:33,679
I don't know.

248
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,679
I don't know.

249
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,679
I don't know.

250
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:36,679
I'm a pro.

251
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,679
I'm a pro.

252
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,679
Shut up.

253
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,679
You were a gorilla suit.

254
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,679
You were a gorilla suit.

255
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:42,679
That's awful.

256
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:45,679
That's a difference.

257
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,679
Hey, what's this?

258
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,679
I'm sorry.

259
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:49,679
I didn't do that.

260
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:50,679
I was going to do the loop.

261
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,679
No, no.

262
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,679
No, no.

263
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,679
I'm going to have to eat rubber chicken.

264
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:55,679
I cut that out, Ben.

265
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,679
We're not putting that in there.

266
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,679
In the beginning.

267
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,679
You just want to see it.

268
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,679
Break you.

269
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,679
I'm gonna give him a little.

270
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,679
No.

271
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,679
I can't.

272
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,679
I can't do that.

273
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,679
I can't do that.

274
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:08,679
Go ahead.

275
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,679
I can't do that.

276
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:10,679
I can't do that.

277
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,679
I can't do that.

278
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,679
I can't do that.

279
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
I can't do that.

280
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,679
Get your knuckles up.

281
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:15,679
Get your knuckles up.

282
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,679
Get your knuckles up.

283
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:17,679
I can't do that.

284
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:18,679
I can't do that.

285
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,679
Cut all that out, please.

286
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:20,679
No, please keep that in.

287
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,679
Oh god.

288
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:22,679
I'm not going to like this one.

289
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:23,679
Why do they call it PMS?

290
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:24,679
Why?

291
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,679
Because Mad Cow Disease was already taken.

292
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,679
Uh huh.

293
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:29,679
Well, that's the...

294
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,439
That's the uh, yeah.

295
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,759
Why is Putin still invading Ukraine?

296
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:36,759
Why?

297
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:39,599
Because once he put in, he doesn't pull out.

298
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,599
Topical.

299
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
Topical.

300
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:47,279
Oh, this, how do you circumcise a hill, Billy?

301
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
How?

302
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,519
Kick his sister in the jaw.

303
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,759
Oh, my God.

304
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,519
These are so good.

305
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,919
Why did Andrew get followed by seven dwarves?

306
00:10:59,599 --> 00:11:00,599
Why?

307
00:11:00,599 --> 00:11:02,599
He was saying, selling snow white.

308
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,919
Not bad.

309
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,279
I really like that one.

310
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,759
Why am I taking it over?

311
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:14,759
You loved it, Bobo.

312
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,959
I got arrested by a female police officer.

313
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:17,959
Did you grab a boobs?

314
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,120
This is, this, you'll love this.

315
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,399
So I got arrested by a female police officer.

316
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:28,799
She told me anything you say can and will be held against you.

317
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,079
So I replied, boobs.

318
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:34,199
My pun client was funny, huh?

319
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,559
What's the difference between women and overs?

320
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,559
What?

321
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:44,319
Drunkman asked before getting inside an Uber.

322
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
All right.

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,079
What's the hardest part of a vegetable to eat?

324
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,079
The wheelchair.

325
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:53,799
Yeah, nice. All right, look at that one out.

326
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:58,839
All right, here you go.

327
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,919
That's a lot.

328
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:00,919
For me?

329
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:03,000
I've decided that we're going to start waiting for you

330
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,319
to take your shots because you really cheat the system.

331
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:06,319
Why?

332
00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:07,959
Because you'll leave it and then wait for the other person

333
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,559
to tell the joke and then take one shot for two laughs.

334
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:12,559
All right.

335
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,599
What do you call an IT teacher who touches up his students?

336
00:12:15,599 --> 00:12:16,599
South.

337
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,279
A PDF file.

338
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,559
Is that...

339
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,639
I'm sorry.

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,799
Bit slavicular?

341
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:35,799
You are? You are?

342
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:36,799
I did laugh.

343
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,799
I'm not a pervert.

344
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,799
I'm not a pervert.

345
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,799
No, he's just a pedophile guy.

346
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,799
I'm not a pervert.

347
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,799
I'll be a pervert, but you'll die if you lose.

348
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
I'm a pervert.

349
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
I think we'll die.

350
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,279
All right, go, go.

351
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,279
I'm running out of jokes.

352
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,279
I know I got a bit more.

353
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:07,279
I'll go.

354
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,279
What is the difference?

355
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,279
Hello.

356
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,279
What's the difference between a pregnant woman and a light bulb?

357
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,279
What?

358
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:16,279
You can't unscrew up.

359
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:18,279
Pregnant woman.

360
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,279
I didn't...

361
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,279
It's like I'm just going to rock the pregnant woman.

362
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:23,279
Been there.

363
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,279
That's...

364
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:26,279
I haven't really been a stop-same being there.

365
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,279
Yeah.

366
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
Because I actually haven't been there.

367
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,279
How do you find a blind man in a nudist colony?

368
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,279
He's the only one without a boughner.

369
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,279
It's not that hard.

370
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,279
Let's close.

371
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,279
All right.

372
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,279
Let's do the barb-sauce.

373
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,279
Yeah, yeah, please.

374
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,279
Let's do the barb-sauce.

375
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,279
Yeah.

376
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,279
I'm sorry.

377
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,279
All right, all right.

378
00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:47,279
I'm sorry.

379
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,279
I'm really sorry.

380
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
Oh, some of these are in fact.

381
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,279
No, you got ten, you got ten.

382
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,279
No, because I...

383
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,279
No, no, no, no, no, no.

384
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,279
No, no, no, no.

385
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,279
Three more left.

386
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,279
Please go.

387
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,279
Okay, um...

388
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,279
Hold on.

389
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:01,279
Bleh.

390
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,279
Bleh.

391
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:04,279
I'm not joking.

392
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:05,279
That's a laugh.

393
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,279
I've wrote it out blu-ah.

394
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,279
That's a laugh.

395
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:09,279
There's not a laugh.

396
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,279
You're back.

397
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:11,279
You're back.

398
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,279
It's a laugh.

399
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,279
I also took a shot for no reason.

400
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:18,279
You've still got a full shot.

401
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,279
That's a laugh.

402
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,279
You've still got a shot.

403
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,279
Take your foot off the table.

404
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,279
I love you together.

405
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,279
Let's have it together.

406
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,279
Cheers.

407
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,279
You're on this chaos.

408
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:27,279
Everything.

409
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,279
Everything is chaos today.

410
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,279
Mmm.

411
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,279
Ugh.

412
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,279
When does a dad joke come a daddy joke?

413
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,279
When.

414
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,279
When he comes.

415
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,279
Why are you looking at the tongue thing?

416
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,279
I have dry lips.

417
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,279
I'm sorry.

418
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:43,279
I have dry lips.

419
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,279
I'm sorry.

420
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,279
I think you killed it.

421
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:47,279
I think you killed it.

422
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,279
I think you killed it.

423
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,279
I didn't have it.

424
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,279
I think you do it better than I do.

425
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,279
Dragon?

426
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,279
Yeah.

427
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,279
That's cute.

428
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:56,279
Please make that stop now.

429
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,279
Just be in a killer.

430
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,279
A killer.

431
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,279
Just call me a killer.

432
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,279
She's a very good girl.

433
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,279
K-SOUL.

434
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,279
K-SOUL.

435
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,279
K-SOUL.

436
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,279
I have to kill her.

437
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,279
I'm sorry, Rises.

438
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,279
That's so bad.

439
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,279
I always cause up my nose.

440
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,279
I've been to 20 minutes ago.

441
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,279
I was told.

442
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,279
20 minutes ago I was told that I was messing a killer.

443
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:23,279
It's a shot.

444
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:24,279
That's not an excuse.

445
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:25,279
That was genuinely the truth.

446
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,279
Do I look alive?

447
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:27,279
Come here.

448
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
No, you don't look like an owl.

449
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,279
At all.

450
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,279
Do you look alive to you?

451
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:35,279
Ah, never.

452
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,279
Bitch.

453
00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:38,279
Delicious.

454
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,279
This is how I get killed.

455
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,279
You have to do it.

456
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:44,279
You have to do it.

457
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,279
You have to look like an owl.

458
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,279
You have such different facial structures.

459
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,279
Okay, don't race it.

460
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
And I'm like a pervert.

461
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,279
I'm not a pervert.

462
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:00,279
Still a racist, not a pervert.

463
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,279
It's invisible.

464
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,279
Yeah, this is great.

465
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:05,279
It's great content.

466
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,279
Please make use of that.

467
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,279
I can't.

468
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:09,279
This one's great.

469
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,279
What does a homeless woman use for a vibrator?

470
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,279
What?

471
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:15,279
Two bees in a bottle.

472
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,279
That's funny.

473
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:20,279
Ah, alright.

474
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,279
Oh, I should probably...

475
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,279
Am I still doing fan jokes?

476
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,279
I would.

477
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:27,279
Oh, yeah.

478
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,279
I think it's a girl.

479
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,279
I don't know.

480
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,279
I'm a big surzer.

481
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,279
That's it.

482
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,279
What do you call a woman herfuses to give head?

483
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,279
What?

484
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:42,279
An oba.

485
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:44,279
Hahaha.

486
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:46,279
Hahaha.

487
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:48,279
Hahaha.

488
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,279
I don't know.

489
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,279
I'm a bit faster.

490
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:54,279
You're the last thing.

491
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,279
You're a f**king pervert.

492
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:57,279
I'm not a pervert.

493
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,279
I don't have my voice.

494
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,279
You're a sh** pervert.

495
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:04,279
I killed her, shut up.

496
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:07,759
I'm the only brown comedian on this fucking show, okay?

499
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:13,759
Oh my god, I'm so good.

500
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:14,759
OK.

501
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,759
Yep.

502
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:18,279
I don't blind people.

503
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,599
Shut up, you're probably doing it.

504
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,879
Shut up, Akill, no one asked you.

505
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:25,079
I don't blind people, Skydive.

506
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,240
Why?

507
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,720
Scares the shit out of their dogs.

510
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
I'm not a baby.

514
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Sorry, baby.

515
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,960
I'm not a girl, my god.

518
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Yes, I'm a girl.

519
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
I'm going to come here.

520
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Oh my god, come here.

521
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,960
I'm going to come here.

522
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
I have a problem.

523
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Take the permits stuff.

524
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
I don't think anyone will like that.

526
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I'm not a permit.

527
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I'm not a permit.

529
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm not a permit.

530
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Sorry, please.
