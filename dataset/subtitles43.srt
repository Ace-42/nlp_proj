1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
Did you hear about the Asian girl with the last name China?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:05,799
No, what happened?

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:07,480
It was her maid in name.

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,480
Music, good boy, music, good boy.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Ah, the fuck.

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,480
Sorry.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,480
Ah, this is a Halloween episode.

9
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:37,479
What?

10
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:39,479
This is a Halloween, yeah, man, Halloween episode.

11
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,479
You used to be wearing some coral dress.

12
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,479
You used to dress...

13
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:42,479
Happy Halloween.

14
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,479
Happy Halloween, everyone.

15
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,479
Yes.

16
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,479
I think you used to dress up.

17
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,479
You two dress like racists?

18
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:49,479
No, I'm not wearing the white one, too.

19
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,479
What do you work?

20
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,479
Joke cartel.

21
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:53,479
Joking off horses?

22
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:55,479
You have four hours, could you clue?

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,479
Oh!

25
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:00,479
All right.

26
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,479
All right.

27
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,479
What do you dress up as?

28
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,479
Huh?

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,479
What do you dress up as?

30
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,480
I've missed the memory.

31
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I don't know.

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,480
I'll have to get dressed up either.

34
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
Oh, shhh.

35
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,480
All right, should we do this?

36
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,480
You guys just missed our great riff.

37
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
Yeah.

38
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
You guys happy?

39
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
Can you guys happy?

40
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't.

41
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,480
I couldn't.

43
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Oh, I'm glad you did that.

45
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Let's do this.

46
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,480
This is a paper rock.

47
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,480
OK.

48
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
This is a paper rock?

49
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Yeah.

50
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,480
See this paper rock?

51
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,480
Yes!

52
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,480
What the f-

53
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,480
Yes!

54
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Cookie, it was a cookie.

55
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
No, that was scissors.

56
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
All right.

57
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
All right.

58
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
So Halloween theme jokes?

59
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Yeah.

60
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,480
All right, let's go.

61
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Why do witches wear no panties?

62
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,480
Why?

63
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,480
For better grip on the broom.

67
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Tsk!

69
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,480
I don't know how I'm carrying them out.

70
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,480
That's good.

71
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,480
What's a vampire's favorite fruit?

72
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,480
What is it?

73
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
A nectarine!

75
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,480
What is a vampire's favorite part of sex?

76
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
What?

77
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,479
E-draculating.

79
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,479
That's good.

80
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,479
And what are you going to do to the voice, Elsa?

81
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,479
E-draculating.

82
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,479
That's good to know.

83
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,479
Oh, roll!

85
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:44,479
You're funny.

89
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,479
E-draculating.

90
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:54,479
E-draculating.

91
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:56,479
Really good drunken.

92
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,479
Yeah, pretty easy.

94
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,479
Ugh.

95
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:04,479
What?

96
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,479
How do two mummies...

97
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,479
How do two mummies settle an argument?

98
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,479
How, Ellie?

99
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:15,479
They have a rap battle.

101
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,479
Why?

102
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,479
No, I'm no.

103
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,479
That's fine.

104
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,479
The Asian voice?

105
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,479
They have a rap battle.

106
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,479
It's going to get so much worse.

108
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,479
How do you mean alcohol, again?

111
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:43,479
He's been a hard boy since birth!

112
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:47,479
So, do you think you're different from the old man?

113
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:49,479
To do the voice!

114
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,479
To do the voice!

115
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,479
Oh, boy!

117
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,479
It's going to be a joke.

119
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:03,479
No, no, no.

120
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,479
No, no.

121
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,479
Let me cook.

122
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,479
All right.

123
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,479
Why did the vampire break up with his girlfriend?

124
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,479
Why?

125
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,480
He tastes like garlic.

129
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,480
Oh, fuck.

130
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,480
It's unofficial.

131
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,480
No.

132
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,480
What do you call an Asian chihuahua?

133
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,480
What?

134
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,480
A kunichiwawa.

136
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Kunichiwawawa.

137
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Kunichiwawawa.

138
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,480
You laugh!

139
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,480
Oh, god.

140
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,480
Did I?

141
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Is that kane as a laugh?

142
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,480
I hope there's some peanut butter in that.

143
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
I'm sweating.

144
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,480
You're going to be sweating on your upper lip.

145
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
There's a good boy.

146
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,480
Look it off.

148
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It was like soy sauce.

152
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
Should I have one of different costumes?

153
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
Maybe I'll lab...

154
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
A lab shade and an enjoy...

155
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I'll cost you.

156
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
With some spring rolls tied in my hair.

157
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Some sushi?

158
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Yeah, yeah.

159
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
All right, get on, go.

160
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Sushi, what on my...

161
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
Oh, sorry.

162
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
Oh, sorry about that.

163
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
It's really hot.

164
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Oh, my god.

165
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,480
That's a killer.

166
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Oh, gr-

167
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Hey, do you try to do that?

168
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Yeah, I can't see.

169
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Growing up as a fat kid was hard.

170
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
The only thing more embarrassing than your parents,

171
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
dressing you up as a summa wrestler,

172
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,480
is when you can't fit in that costume.

173
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,480
Oh, this is bad.

174
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,480
What kind of dog likes having a bath every day?

175
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
Sexy dog.

177
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,480
A shampooodle.

178
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Well, I heard it was poo.

179
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Yeah.

180
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
All right.

181
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Did I?

182
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Yeah.

183
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
Like, look at the bit that said it.

184
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
Give him your bath.

185
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,480
What?

186
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Ready?

187
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,480
Why did the vampire leave his job at the blood bank,

188
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,480
and get a new job at the sperm bank?

189
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Because he was tired of sucking next.

190
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
He wanted to suck some fucking shit out.

191
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
That was so bad.

192
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm going to ride off the shore.

193
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,480
What was that rise?

194
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,480
I'm going to come on.

195
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Yeah, I'm on.

196
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Do you like that?

197
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Yeah.

198
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,480
Do you like it?

199
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,480
Err...

200
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,480
What do Americans and Asians have in common?

201
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Do Americans have a good life?

202
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
Yeah.

203
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Do you like it?

204
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Err...

205
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
What do Americans and Asians have in common?

206
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Err...

207
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
What?

208
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
They both love hot dogs.

210
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
It was a pretty hot dog yourself.

211
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Do you want to eat me?

212
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Yeah, I want to nibble you up.

213
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Eat my ass.

214
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Oh my god.

215
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Put you in a Yulung festival.

216
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:45,480
Yulung dog festival.

217
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Yeah.

218
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
I fucking keep talking to her.

220
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Fuck you.

221
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
Oh, jeez.

222
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,480
All right.

223
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Okay, okay.

224
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
That nose won't be there.

225
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,480
That's what.

228
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:15,480
I carved out a pumpkin to look like sats head.

229
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
But I wanted to make it really accurate.

230
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,480
It's completely empty inside.

231
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Did you paint it brown?

232
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Yeah.

233
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,480
But I didn't have any brown paint, so I used a piece of shit.

237
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
All right, I'm done with the Halloween jokes.

238
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,480
Back to regular racist jokes.

239
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
Back to regular...

240
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,480
Yeah, mad racist jokes.

241
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,480
Did you hear about the Asian girl with the last name China?

242
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
No, what happened?

243
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,480
It was her maid in name.

247
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,480
No.

248
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
The general pant...

249
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
Yeah, I'm over with the Halloween stuff as well.

251
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Sorry, I couldn't leave that many.

252
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,480
The general pants near my local Westfield is getting a big upgrade.

253
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
It's becoming a sergeant pants.

255
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
That's good.

256
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,480
I like that.

257
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
It's not a page of jail jokes, but it's...

259
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
A general's a higher rank than a sergeant.

260
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

262
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
Or would you know about a government?

263
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
You fucking...

264
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
You fucking criminal.

265
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
What do you...

266
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
What do you call it when a criminal stops an Asian from shitting?

267
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
What?

268
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
Constop Asian.

270
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Is that your ghostwriter?

271
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
Yeah, that's really good.

273
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,480
You're the one joking.

274
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I'm throwing a big Halloween party at the Sydney Fish Market.

275
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Or as other people call it,

276
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
I'm going to get a new one.

277
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
I'm going to get a new one.

278
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,480
I'm throwing a big Halloween party at the Sydney Fish Market.

279
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,480
Or as other people call it,

280
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Abbie's vagina.

283
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,480
Yeah, what's up, man?

284
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
We're saving a lot of money on the cobwebs.

286
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
Different Abbie.

287
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Different Abbie.

288
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,480
No, that one.

289
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,480
An old Asian man ordered 42 coffees

290
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,480
and the waiter said, sir, are you sure?

291
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
And he said, yeah, that's what I want.

292
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
So the waiter said it?

293
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Yeah, yeah.

294
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
The waiter started pouring seven coffees

295
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
and the Asian man shouted, stop, stop.

296
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,480
I said, 42 coffees.

298
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,480
What?

300
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
Steven, Steven.

301
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
Let's just...

302
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
When they go low, we go high.

303
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
The race stuff.

305
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
So this isn't me going high.

306
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
The homeless guy on my street

307
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,480
is going as Britney Spears for Halloween.

308
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Or at least I think he's going for Britney Spears.

309
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I just saw him outside a centralink dancing with knives.

310
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
We're pretty old!

311
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
We're pretty pretty, bitch.

312
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Yeah.

313
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I don't get it.

314
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,480
Exactly.

315
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,480
That's toxic.

317
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Well, I don't get that anyway.

318
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah, don't worry.

319
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
Fucking shit.

320
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
What do Asian cannibals eat?

321
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
Um...

322
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I don't know what I don't know what.

324
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Roll man.

325
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
They're grounded.

327
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Can you take of you?

328
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Whatever that is?

329
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
Why?

330
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,480
I want to see eyes.

331
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
So you can make fun of me for them?

333
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
I want to see your eyes, so I can pull them back as well.

334
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,480
And make these jokes a lot better.

336
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Why did the vampire order the extra spicy curry?

337
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Right.

338
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
He wanted something with a bit of bite.

340
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Why can't Asian men never masturbate to Asian fun?

341
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Why?

342
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Because everyone looks like their sister.

345
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
I know, man.

347
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,480
I thought we were just telling some wholesome Halloween jokes, but...

349
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
Like a genre of fishmonger.

351
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Oh my god.

352
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Oh...

353
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
I like this one again.

354
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Asian guy is driving his girlfriend to the beach, right?

355
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
Yeah.

356
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
And she whispers in, is he, let me give you some Edwell you drive.

357
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
So...

363
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Where?

365
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
Where's the she said, let me give you some Edwell you drive.

366
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,480
So she goes to Um zip his pants and she goes, is it really true what they say about Asian men?

367
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
And he goes, unfortunately, yes.

368
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
And then he crashes and they both die.

371
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Oh my god.

373
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Do you ride that?

374
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Ah!

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
Do you ride that?

376
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
Do you ride that?

377
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
Do you ride that?

378
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I do.

380
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,480
I tried that at the laugh in zero laughs.

381
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
I like it.

382
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
I don't know what I'm talking about.

383
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I'm technically Asian.

385
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:07,480
What happens when a gay person gets tired during the Maddie Grah parade?

386
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:13,480
They have to drink a gay to raid at the gay parade.

387
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
You know what?

388
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
I like it.

389
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I did ride that.

390
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
You look like a Ryan Vincere.

393
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Why do you now Asian kids don't believe in Santa?

394
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Why?

395
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
Because they make all the toys.

396
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
You need fucking pieces of shit.

397
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
You feel good about yourself?

398
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Make the white people laugh?

399
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Yeah, let's make all the white people laugh without racial humour.

400
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm so afraid.

401
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
I'm so afraid.

402
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
Can we rap battle?

403
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Sath is so creepy.

405
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,480
His version of unwinding is uploading revenge porn.

406
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Oh!

407
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Alright, cut that.

408
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Don't ever do that.

409
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Don't ever use that.

410
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,480
The audience was asking for a specific type of humour

411
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,480
and I appealed to them.

412
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I don't want to get into it.

413
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
I might want to retract that later.

414
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
I might want to retract that later.

415
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,480
Alright, why can't Elvis parallel Pock?

416
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Why?

417
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Because he's dead.

419
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
That's funny.

420
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
That's why.

422
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
That's why he's so aggressive at all.

423
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Yeah, cut that out.

425
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Why is my girlfriend like a maths exam?

426
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
Why?

427
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Because I'm cheating on her with an Asian.

430
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Well, as punishment,

431
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I have to eat you now.

432
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Because you would dress like a dog.

435
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
Oh, no!

436
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Oh, you're a bit of a...

438
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Oh, yeah.

439
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,480
You're a bit...

440
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
You're a bit...

441
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Eat me.

442
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Eat me a lot.

443
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Eat him.

444
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,480
You're a bit...

445
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Alright, but if I stand on this, will it break?

446
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Yes.

450
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
I have one.

451
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
What?

452
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
That's what I'm saying.

453
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
What's he doing with my girlfriend and mouse?

454
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
What's he doing?

456
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,480
That's what I'm saying.

457
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,480
That's what I'm saying.

458
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
That's what I'm saying.
