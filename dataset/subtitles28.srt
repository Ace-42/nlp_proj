1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,280
To Targill's.

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,280
Alright, I think you're gonna want to go.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,280
No!

4
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,280
No!

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,280
Hello.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,080
Guten Tag, Freyline!

7
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,080
Ha ha ha ha!

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,080
Yes.

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,080
You do be looking like a beautiful smettling.

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:29,919
You're gonna have a face.

11
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:33,399
You look great, man.

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,399
Cheese cobbler.

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:41,280
Oh, I don't think she's gentlemen now.

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,599
You see this baby rocked to go first?

15
00:00:42,599 --> 00:00:44,599
Yeah, sure, why not?

16
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,599
See, this is a baby rock.

17
00:00:46,599 --> 00:00:48,599
See, this is a baby rock.

18
00:00:48,599 --> 00:00:50,599
Yeah, wait, you go.

19
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:52,599
Oh, fuck.

20
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,599
Okay.

21
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,079
What do...

22
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,600
What does peanut butter and strippers have in common?

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,439
They both spread for bread.

24
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,400
It's a good start.

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
Thank you.

26
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,799
Maybe guys.

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,799
Why can't you never get any painkillers in the jungle?

28
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:23,799
Why?

29
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,799
Because parrots eat a ball.

30
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,760
Ha ha!

31
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:35,560
Bring a spoon.

32
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,079
What type of a bird gives the best head?

33
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,079
A swallow.

34
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,039
Fuck.

35
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,319
mangoes.

36
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,319
You're a bottle-eak.

37
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,319
We didn't count me in the form of a cake with the racnitz.

38
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,319
That was really a bottle-up.

39
00:02:03,319 --> 00:02:05,319
Form a cake with the racnitz.

40
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,319
I didn't.

41
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,319
Doesn't count.

42
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,319
I accidentally took my cats meds yesterday.

43
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,319
They're not us me out.

44
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,319
Go.

45
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,319
No, I did it! I did it!

46
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,319
She is to your face.

47
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,319
She is.

48
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,319
You as an Andrews pretty face.

49
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,319
All right.

50
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,319
What's the best thing about having sex with 28-year-olds?

51
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:48,319
Tell me.

52
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,319
There's 20 of them.

53
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:50,319
Cool.

54
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
There was a lot of my projects and things.

55
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,319
What's French and love's blood jobs?

56
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,319
What?

57
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,319
What?

58
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,319
I know. I know.

59
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
That's what I'm doing.

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,319
That's what I'm doing.

61
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,319
You're me.

62
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,319
Oh.

63
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:26,319
What's up?

64
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,319
I'm talking to that not being a criminal.

65
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,319
I thought I was going to win this one for sure.

66
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,319
Yeah, I'm not sure.

67
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
The Darren Pooh.

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,319
The yoga bugger.

69
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,319
It's good.

70
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,319
What did you think I was?

71
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,319
I thought we were just f***ing us.

72
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,319
Well, but what did you think I was dressed as?

73
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,319
Me, apparently.

74
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,319
That is so funny.

75
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,319
That's how it is.

76
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,319
You ran. That's good.

77
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,319
She's the devos.

78
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:09,319
She is the devos.

79
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
She's the one.

80
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,319
She's the one.

81
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:15,319
She's the one.

82
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,319
She's really dressed down.

83
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:22,319
She is the sun.

84
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,319
She's so funny.

85
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,319
Oh my god.

86
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:28,319
No, no, no.

87
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,319
No, not on.

88
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,319
No, she's the one.

89
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,319
Why did the chicken cross the road?

90
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:37,319
Why did the chicken cross the road?

91
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,319
To get to the idiot's house.

92
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,319
Knock, knock.

93
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:42,319
Knock.

94
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,319
Who's there?

95
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,319
The chicken!

96
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:50,319
You're an idiot.

97
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:52,319
You're a dead-set idiot.

98
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,319
This is so bad.

99
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,319
I loved it.

100
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,319
Are you going to this one?

101
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,319
Yeah, I'll try that one because that's like...

102
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,319
Really hitting it back with her today.

103
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:11,319
This is the cinnamon.

104
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,319
This one's got the cinnamon.

105
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,319
Oh my god.

106
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,319
Okay, that's a very full shot.

107
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,319
It's fine.

108
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:17,319
We just get cheese every time.

109
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,319
Look at that cheese every time.

110
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,319
I'm sitting too close to the staff and I was about to take something.

111
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,319
Really pervert.

112
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,319
What are you doing?

113
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,319
Smell like curry.

114
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:25,319
No, it's going to say...

115
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,319
Sam's legs look fucking fantastic.

116
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,319
You doing it?

117
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,319
Rub it on my hand.

118
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,319
You doing it?

119
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:34,319
Yeah.

120
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,319
You do that look great.

121
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,319
Pervert Abby is back.

122
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,319
You can't see them.

123
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:39,319
It's not funny.

124
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,319
Okay, go.

125
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,319
That was great.

126
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,319
Thank you.

127
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,319
You got this.

128
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:47,319
You got this.

129
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,319
You're welcome.

130
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,319
This is going to ruin all the jokes coming up.

131
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
So let's get stuck into those, eh?

132
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,319
What would a Japanese foot have for dinner?

133
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:59,319
What?

134
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:00,319
Shushi.

135
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,319
It's good.

136
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
You don't like sushi?

137
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,319
No, likes sushi.

138
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,319
Shushi.

139
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,319
Shushi.

140
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,319
Yeah, sushi.

141
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,319
What do you call a guy with a small dick?

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,319
Please help.

143
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,319
Please be a killer.

144
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,319
Fuck.

145
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,319
Go back.

146
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,319
I said the same thing.

147
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,319
I said the same thing.

148
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,319
That was so funny.

149
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,319
Because it's not your turn Abby.

150
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,319
Do you want the punch?

151
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,319
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,319
It's all right.

153
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,319
Just in.

154
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,319
Just in.

155
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:47,319
Good?

156
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:48,319
Yeah.

157
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,319
Yeah.

158
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,319
Yeah.

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,319
Did I laugh?

160
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:55,319
Yeah, we both laughed.

161
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,319
And everyone laughed.

162
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,319
And there was a Joyce occasion.

163
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,319
Everyone had a great time.

164
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,319
You just filled the game out, then.

165
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,319
Who's it?

166
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,319
Yeah.

167
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,319
How does a frog fill when he breaks his foot?

168
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,319
I'm not happy.

169
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,319
We've got to get some fillers in there.

170
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
We've got to get some fillers in there.

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,319
That's good.

172
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,319
Thank you.

173
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
All right.

174
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,319
There we go.

175
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
What would you do if you came across a tiger in the jungle?

176
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,319
Scream.

177
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,319
Apologize and rub it off.

178
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,319
If Matt came across a tiger in the jungle.

179
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
Yeah.

180
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,319
You're a tiger.

181
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,319
Tiger.

182
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
Tiger in the jungle.

183
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,319
Well structured.

184
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
The actual workers make sense.

185
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,319
If it came across a tiger.

186
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
If it came across a tiger, you know.

187
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,319
I can't hear a joke on me racist.

188
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,319
I don't get it.

189
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,319
I was there.

190
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:09,319
I was there.

191
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:11,319
I was there.

192
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:13,319
I was there.

193
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,319
I was there.

194
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,319
I got into a museum throughout New Hampshire.

195
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,319
I got into a museum.

196
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:23,319
To the table.

197
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:25,319
To the table.

198
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:27,319
All right.

199
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:29,319
I think you're going to have to go.

200
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:31,319
Yeah.

201
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:33,319
Yeah.

202
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Yeah.

203
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah.

204
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
Yeah.

205
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
It's really really exciting.

206
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Nothing around here.

207
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
No.

208
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Yeah.

209
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Yeah.

210
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Yeah.

211
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Yeah.

212
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Yeah.

213
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Yeah.

214
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Yeah.

215
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Yeah.

216
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Yeah.

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
What's the rush?

218
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,320
I don't know.

219
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,320
I don't want to do the short that we probably shouldn't just done.

220
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,320
How do you circumcise a hillbilly?

221
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Oh.

222
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
You know.

223
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
Maybe.

224
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Kiki's sister, the male.

225
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,320
I've heard it as well.

226
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I was just out of the sound.

227
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
We did it.

228
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
We did it.

229
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I was holding it out.

230
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
We're editing that.

231
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
We've done it.

232
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I'm fucking Saturday there.

233
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Saturday there.

234
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Did I do that joke?

235
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
No.

236
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I did that joke.

237
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
But I laughed at that joke.

238
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I can't go on.

239
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Shut up the fuck up lady Gaga.

240
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
Shut up.

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Lady Gaga.

242
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Lady Gaga.

243
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Lady Gaga.

244
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
All right.

245
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Okay.

246
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,320
What Sam's least favourite Italian dessert?

247
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Like me?

248
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
You.

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Sam.

250
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Sam.

251
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
What is your least favourite Italian dessert?

252
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I hate all pasta.

253
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
I don't know.

254
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
I don't know.

255
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Oh, it's...

256
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
Are in Cheney?

257
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
I don't like that either.

258
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
Let me say that.

259
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Let me say the joke one more time for Samantha.

260
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay?

261
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
We're going to really dive into this one.

262
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Samantha.

263
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:45,320
What is your least favourite Italian dessert?

264
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
Can I say wine?

265
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
You're going to get close to it.

266
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
You can't fare enough for her.

267
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Like the lemon joke.

268
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Yeah, anyway.

269
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
We're going to switch the joke up.

270
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Sam's least favourite Italian dessert is...

271
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,320
...Tur-Tur-Tur-Machoux.

272
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Tur-Tur-Machoux.

273
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,320
She doesn't like the word, she doesn't like it.

274
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,320
Tur-Tur-Machoux.

275
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
I'm looking...

276
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
Come on man!

277
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I just sat there for fucking weeks!

278
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,320
Coming up with this joke takes you guys two days!

279
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
That's the best of God!

280
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Like a tear in the shoe.

281
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
Yeah, yeah.

282
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
It's half-hage for that one.

283
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Because you're laughing and not...

284
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
I'm spitting into your mouth.

285
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
You do it.

286
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
What?

287
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
What?

288
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,320
It's my son.

289
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
What?

290
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
What?

291
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
You want to feed him?

292
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I want to feed him.

293
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
You're telling me to feed him.

294
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
You better help me.

295
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
No, they're not.

296
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
I have a suit of milk.

297
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,320
We're going to be doing this next half completely blind.

298
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
You're going to have to feed him.

299
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
You're going to have to feed him.

300
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I'm going to have to feed him.

301
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I'm going to have to feed him.

302
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
You guys see him?

303
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Now I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

304
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
I'm going to have to feed him.

305
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
You've got to feed him.

306
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Go on, I'm gonna feed him.

307
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm going to have to feed him.

308
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm going to have to feed him.

309
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
Go on, follow me.

310
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,320
All right, follow me.

311
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
I have to feed him.

312
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
This is great content guys.

313
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Keep it up, keep it up.

314
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
We're going great.

315
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Where are we at this one?

316
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Okay, we're good.

317
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
We're good.

318
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, I'm the boy.

319
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,320
What did the American foot send the terrorist foot?

320
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Bissletoe.

321
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Oh, terrorist foot.

322
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
It actually showed up.

323
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
It's so dark.

324
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
The Americans are the terrorists.

325
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
It's a terror to me.

326
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Let me sort of talk.

327
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Terrorist foot.

328
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,320
What are you good people?

329
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,320
It locked us where I keep a dune.

330
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
I don't care.

331
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I don't care anymore.

332
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
Who cares?

333
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
We got one.

334
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
We're going through all these jokes.

335
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Now we don't give them off.

336
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
What happened?

337
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,320
What do you call a nurse with dirty knees?

338
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,320
Go.

339
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
The head nurse.

340
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
What are you rushing me?

341
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
Oh, the fucking nurse.

342
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
We're good.

343
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
What's that up?

344
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
We're doing this area.

345
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,320
It was a very funny one.

346
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Head nurse.

347
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Because she gave him head and she's a nurse.

348
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Getting him knees.

349
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Getting him knees.

350
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Rusted up.

351
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Suck in some f***ing.

352
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
That's great.

353
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Put in some catheters and f***ing suck it them off.

354
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I love it.

355
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
What else we got?

356
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
Anyway, we're going back to this.

357
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,320
All right.

358
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,320
It's a man for?

359
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I can't take you seriously.

360
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,320
You can't take me seriously because we're being serious.

361
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:31,320
I hear that people with a foot fetish have a highly active socks life.

362
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
How's your socks life going, Sammy?

363
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm actually about to...

364
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
No, I don't know.

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Surely it's terrific.

366
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

367
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Let's get on with it.

368
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,320
I need to defeat you.

369
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
These socks.

370
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
These socks.

371
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,320
You wearing shoes today?

372
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Why?

373
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Okay, go.

374
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
That socked.

375
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
That socked.

376
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
That socked.

377
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,320
That's way better.

378
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
That was good, Matt. That was great.

379
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Thank you, Seth. I love you.

380
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Did you eat laughing at any of that?

381
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,320
No.

382
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,320
Did you eat laughing at that?

383
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
You really toe-dazzled that one.

384
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Oh, jeez to you.

385
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I can go, go, go, go, go.

386
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Okay.

387
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,320
What do you get when you jingle a man's balls?

388
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,320
When you jingle a man's balls?

389
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,320
Fuck.

390
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,320
A white Christmas.

391
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell.

392
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Jingle bell ring, jingle bell.

393
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Come on.

394
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm laughing.

395
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
In the frosty air.

396
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Um.

397
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I'm going to, can I do one that, that,

398
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,320
can I do one that wasn't allowed,

399
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
like that hasn't been shown in a previous one?

400
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,320
Yeah.

401
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Okay, but it's the first time you've

402
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
hit it or a,

403
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
hit it.

404
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Who's that being beaten?

405
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Matt Scott, Matt Scott, the brain capacity of a middle schooler.

406
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
You guys, I'm not a middle schooler.

407
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
I need a schooler.

408
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
No.

409
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Why, I'm just going to take these.

410
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,320
I took mine.

411
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Oh, sick.

412
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Why does the Norwegian Navy put barcodes on their ships?

413
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
It's been done.

414
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
I'm never.

415
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
The Norwegian Army has been done.

416
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,320
I never been to say that in the whole time we've been to.

417
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
Why you do that, buddy?

418
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Yeah, I do.

419
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
But like, you just said on me.

420
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Yeah, but there's also been so many different ones being read on them.

421
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,320
That's the only one you've ever tried on the whole time.

422
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
What does a burnt pizza, a pregnant woman,

423
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
and a frozen beer having common?

424
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I'm waiting.

425
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,320
Are you meant to say what?

426
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Oh, um.

427
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
What?

428
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Someone forgot to pull it out in time.

429
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,319
Go.

430
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:23,319
Oh, I got you.

431
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:30,319
One, two, three, four, five, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six.

432
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,319
I can't imitate it.

433
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,319
You won't hear it.

434
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:35,319
God bless America.

435
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,319
That's a long now.

436
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,319
Awesome.

437
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,319
Oh, no.

438
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,319
Good job.

439
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,319
I got political at the end.

440
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,319
Yeah.

441
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,319
That's a wrong.

442
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,319
Oh, shit.
