1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
It's with all the yelling.

2
00:00:01,580 --> 00:00:03,560
Leonard disproved my element.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,780
Now all the attention is going to go away.

4
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:07,540
Oh, that's great, you must be thrilled.

5
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,380
That's it.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,740
I'm down to seven friends.

7
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:15,179
I was counting habits and superheroes, right?

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,740
When I saw that the element was real, I didn't want it.

9
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:19,740
But now that Leonard made it not exist,

10
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,940
I want it more than anything in the world.

11
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,699
The element never existed.

12
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,780
I didn't take it away.

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,580
Science took it away.

14
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,620
Be mad at science.

15
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,740
Don't you dare.

16
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,940
You science against me.

17
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,940
Science is my best friend.

18
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:32,539
Oh, good.

19
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,179
I'm back up to eight.

20
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:37,179
Will you tell him he's out of his mind?

21
00:00:37,179 --> 00:00:38,500
Actually, I get what he's saying.

22
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,660
Yes, nine.

23
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:40,500
Welcome back, buddy.

24
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,460
It's like if you're dating someone, you're not that into,

25
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,780
and then they break up with you, and then you

26
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,740
want them more than ever.

27
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,939
I have no idea what she's talking about.

28
00:00:49,939 --> 00:00:53,579
We're getting up on you, so I agree.

29
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,180
OK, Shogun, what do you want me to do?

30
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,380
Highly the information.

31
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,980
If I don't publish it, it's just a matter of time

32
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,340
before someone else does.

33
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,940
But no, no.

34
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,140
Of course you have to publish.

35
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,020
That your responsibility is a scientist.

36
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:05,740
Doing otherwise would be unethical.

37
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,900
You have no choice.

38
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,780
Fine, I'll publish.

39
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,820
Can you believe this guy?

40
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,900
This is fun.

41
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,700
I'm going to feel like such a vixen wearing jewelry

42
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,700
that doesn't have a list of medications I'm allergic to.

43
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,219
Benny, how's it going over there?

44
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:19,460
Good.

45
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,020
I'm just having a little trouble with the glue.

46
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,420
How do you not know how to use glue?

47
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,579
Did you ditch preschool?

48
00:01:28,099 --> 00:01:30,459
Yeah, only because I was dating a second grader.

49
00:01:33,739 --> 00:01:35,140
Hello, everyone.

50
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,459
OK, let me have it.

51
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:40,379
Let's hear all the rages of girl jokes.

52
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,379
No, Bernard, that's only, does it nice?

53
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,739
And I'm not allowed.

54
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:44,579
Thank you.

55
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,099
So I won't be making fun of you or the things you like

56
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,579
or the fact that you just want to have fun.

57
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:54,859
Howdy, stop.

58
00:01:54,859 --> 00:01:56,299
Come on, look at what I'm eating.

59
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,060
It's actually pretty nice.

60
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,060
I'm making a bracelet.

61
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,420
Yeah, I'm just making a mess.

62
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:07,019
You know, instead of beads and glue,

63
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:08,460
you guys can use my soldering iron.

64
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,299
You'd be able to make much cooler stuff.

65
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,579
Well, I think we're doing just fine.

66
00:02:12,579 --> 00:02:13,979
Thank you.

67
00:02:13,979 --> 00:02:15,740
Actually, I'd kind of like to try that.

68
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,539
I can't do it.

69
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:19,019
You'd be right back.

70
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:21,900
When did I have pistachios?

71
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,180
Isn't that Professor Proton?

72
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,379
Oh, yeah.

73
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:26,579
Oh.

74
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:29,340
Oh.

75
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,340
Look at him.

76
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,419
He's standing in line like he wasn't

77
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,859
moderately famous 30 years ago.

78
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,019
Let's go say hello.

79
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:38,979
Oh, maybe we shouldn't bother him.

80
00:02:38,979 --> 00:02:40,180
I'm not going to bother him.

81
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,340
I'm going to talk to him.

82
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,579
He thinks there's a difference.

83
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,139
Arthur.

84
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:49,500
Arthur, it's me, Sheldon Cooper.

85
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,180
But you may not remember because of your advanced age.

86
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,099
Trust me, I remember.

87
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,340
But this is my girlfriend, Amy.

88
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
This is television legend Arthur Jeffries.

89
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,460
His science show inspired millions of children.

90
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,140
Hold on.

91
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,420
You have a girlfriend.

92
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,659
Yes, and I've heard so much about you.

93
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:18,379
Hey, look, we're wearing the same worth of pedic shoes.

94
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,939
Can't believe I dressed like a celebrity.

95
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:26,740
Oh, OK, I got it now.

96
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,020
Dr. Jeffries, hello again, lettered hostetter.

97
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,020
Oh, all right.

98
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:34,300
I remember you're girlfriend.

99
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,139
Is she here?

100
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,139
No, she's not.

101
00:03:40,139 --> 00:03:41,939
So what prescription are you getting filled?

102
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:42,780
That's Sheldon.

103
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
You know, I want to guess.

104
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,419
Don't tell me.

105
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,579
I wasn't going to tell you.

106
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:49,500
Sheldon, come on.

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
No, no, no, I'm really good at this.

108
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,659
Give me a hint.

109
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,300
Does it involve difficulty initiating

110
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,659
a stream of anything?

111
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:02,699
Well, given my age, that's more than just a lucky guess.

112
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:04,379
Hey, Sheldon, let's go mock the people

113
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:05,659
buying homeopathic medicine.

114
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,020
You love that.

115
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,699
But I'm hanging out with my friend.

116
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:10,219
We're having fun.

117
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:11,539
Look how happy he is.

118
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,420
Arthur doesn't have those kind of resources.

119
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,259
No, and that's why he had air and pace, rewire.

120
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,140
How do you even gotten to my scene yet?

121
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,740
I know, but you're going to be a TV star,

122
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,620
and you haven't left me yet.

123
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,140
That takes guts.

124
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,220
I don't know about you, but I'm very uncomfortable with all this.

125
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,180
Why?

126
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,980
I've never seen this show before.

127
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,860
And now I'm starting with episode 246.

128
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,780
It's unnatural.

129
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,379
Just think of the first 245 as the prequel.

130
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
All right.

131
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,540
Let me show you guys this is it.

132
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,620
I guess it's you and me, too.

133
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,379
What are you doing?

134
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:57,140
I'm trying to make peace.

135
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,780
We're good.

136
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,460
Good.

137
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,340
Are you kidding me?

138
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,220
What's wrong?

139
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,980
Well, the diner scene.

140
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,340
Where's my diner scene?

141
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,420
But don't ask me until I see the prequel I'm lost.

142
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,420
No, there's supposed to be a big scene with me and Mark

143
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,060
Harman, but it's gone.

144
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,819
What happened?

145
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,580
They must have cut it.

146
00:05:16,579 --> 00:05:19,219
Oh, Penny.

147
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:21,019
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:21,539
That's stash.

149
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:22,859
Sure you agreed?

150
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:24,219
This doesn't make any sense to me.

151
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:27,060
I thought I did a really good job.

152
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,539
But excuse me.

153
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:39,299
I've been studying how to make people laugh.

154
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,620
LAUGHTER

155
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:48,660
They say that comedy is tragedy plus time.

156
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,660
Let's take some ribs.

157
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
No.

158
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,300
I think if we want to predict the height of the wave,

159
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,379
we need to use elasticity theory and model the lattice

160
00:05:57,379 --> 00:05:59,980
as one continuous flexible piece.

161
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,300
This is fun.

162
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,900
Playing with popsicle sticks, exploring ways

163
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,259
to store kinetic energy.

164
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:08,379
It's like preschool all over again.

165
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:10,620
Except now if I eat pasted, it's because I want to.

166
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,540
Not because Craig Schultz is making me.

167
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,019
Hey, can I ask you a question?

168
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:17,259
Is it where was the teacher?

169
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,579
She was in the bathroom smoking.

170
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,899
That's where.

171
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:24,980
It wasn't, but I'm glad to see you've moved on.

172
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,259
I was going to ask if being married felt any different.

173
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,620
Oh.

174
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,939
Not really.

175
00:06:31,939 --> 00:06:34,339
Sorry, that probably wasn't the answer you were looking for.

176
00:06:34,339 --> 00:06:36,579
No, actually it is.

177
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:39,339
I mean, Sheldon and I are in a really great place right now,

178
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:42,500
and I just don't want anything to mess that up.

179
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,539
You do remember you're here because he kicked you out

180
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:47,060
of your apartment.

181
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,339
Yes.

182
00:06:48,339 --> 00:06:50,699
His work is important to him.

183
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,419
It's one of the things I find the sexiest about him.

184
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,259
Well, that and...

185
00:06:56,259 --> 00:06:59,259
LAUGHTER

186
00:07:02,259 --> 00:07:04,259
His butt.

187
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:05,620
He has a little snack.

188
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,459
Are you sure you don't want your spy to do it?

189
00:07:08,459 --> 00:07:09,579
What are you talking about?

190
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:10,620
You really don't trust me.

191
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,420
You had to have Amy stop by?

192
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,420
I trust you.

193
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,220
Yeah.

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,100
You were a terrible waitress, and we still

195
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,300
ask you to get us a snack.

196
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,459
LAUGHTER

197
00:07:21,459 --> 00:07:23,540
Excuse me, why go take care of your baby

198
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,300
that I'll bring you your snack, and you can insult me some more.

199
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,780
I don't know about you, but I am not eating whatever she brings us.

200
00:07:33,779 --> 00:07:37,339
We have only the K-A-T-Penny's here.

201
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,339
Shh.

202
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:39,739
Let's get you changed.

203
00:07:39,739 --> 00:07:41,539
Your mommy and daddy say they trust me,

204
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:43,939
but they're full of the same stuff your diaper is.

205
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:45,939
LAUGHTER

206
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:47,739
No, I feel bad.

207
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:49,659
Well, you never really liked me.

208
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:52,019
It's kind of nice you hate you now, too.

209
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,019
But I'm here for you, and I would never let anything happen to you

210
00:07:56,019 --> 00:07:59,419
because your anti-penny loves you so much.

211
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,419
Mama.

212
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,420
LAUGHTER

213
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Was that her first word?

214
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Mama.

215
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,420
Oh, no, no, baby, I'm not your mama.

216
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Your mama's a nice lady.

217
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,420
We're going to go see right now so I can rub this in her face.

218
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Do you hear that sucker?

219
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
She called me Mama.

220
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,420
What's going on?

221
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,420
What if there was something I wanted to do?

222
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,019
But I was worried other people would think less of me.

223
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,420
Is that other person me, and does it happen in the bedroom,

224
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,420
in which case I think I'm cool with it?

225
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:41,420
LAUGHTER

226
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,420
No.

227
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:47,420
It's about working with Bert on, you know what?

228
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,420
I'm not even going to say it.

229
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,420
I am just going to say the letter it starts with, and,

230
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,420
Olaji.

231
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,420
G. Oh, no, no, it's not going to work.

232
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,420
LAUGHTER

233
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Geology?

234
00:08:57,419 --> 00:08:59,419
Yes.

235
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:03,419
But we parted ways because I was worried about my reputation.

236
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:06,419
Sheldon, you've never cared what people thought,

237
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:09,419
even when you really, really should.

238
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:11,419
You okay?

239
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,419
No, I'm very nervous.

240
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,419
LAUGHTER

241
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:17,419
Oh, oh.

242
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:19,419
Oh.

243
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:21,419
Oh.

244
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,419
LAUGHTER

245
00:09:24,419 --> 00:09:26,419
Where are you going?

246
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:27,419
Give shop.

247
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,419
There is no give shops, you know.

248
00:09:29,419 --> 00:09:31,419
LAUGHTER

249
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,419
This was your idea.

250
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:36,419
It's always having sex, and look where that got us.

251
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:39,419
This isn't a big deal. Stop lying to me.

252
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:42,419
When you were in labor and I said that, you kicked me.

253
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:44,419
LAUGHTER

254
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,419
Howard Wallace?

255
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,419
I'll make it with you?

256
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,419
No, I'll be fine.

257
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:52,419
Yeah, we got this.

258
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,419
Sit down.

259
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,419
LAUGHTER

260
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:00,419
Wish me luck.

261
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:02,419
Other way, Buster.

262
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,419
LAUGHTER

263
00:10:07,419 --> 00:10:10,419
Okay, this is a bit awkward.

264
00:10:10,419 --> 00:10:14,419
It says here that I need to check the area for redness and swelling.

265
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:19,419
You know what, it hurt so much, go ahead.

266
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,419
They're going to start making Professor Proton's science show again.

267
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,419
They thought he passed away.

268
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:30,419
He did. It was cremated and his remains were put in the baking soda volcano.

269
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,419
Don't make jokes. He meant a lot to Sheldon.

270
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:35,419
Me too. I grew up watching his show.

271
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:37,419
He's one of the reasons I became a scientist.

272
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:40,419
I thought you did it just to get girls.

273
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,419
Jokes on you, it worked.

274
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,419
You know, they found anyone to replace him?

275
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:48,419
No, not yet. And it won't be easy.

276
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:51,419
Arthur Jeffries was an accomplished scientist.

277
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:54,419
You know who'd make a great Professor Proton?

278
00:10:54,419 --> 00:10:57,419
Merrill Streep.

279
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:59,419
She's not a scientist.

280
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:03,419
Then explain to me why she has chemistry with literally everyone.

281
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,419
LAUGHTER

282
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,419
It would be nice if they cast a woman.

283
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:09,419
You've already got Dr. Who in the Ghostbusters.

284
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,419
Leave us something.

285
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:15,419
Well, this party's a disaster.

286
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:17,419
Don't blame the party.

287
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:22,419
How many favors I'd do calling with my bounce house guy to get Wonder Woman?

288
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:25,419
Is that Wonder Woman?

289
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:30,419
Technically, it's a Chinese knockoff called Happy Strong Simpsuit Lady.

290
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,419
Then I take it back. It's a great party.

291
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:36,419
No, you can sit here and suck if you want.

292
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,419
I'm going to celebrate Halley's first birthday,

293
00:11:38,419 --> 00:11:41,419
which I planned with no help from you.

294
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,419
What are you doing?

295
00:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,419
It's a bounce house. I'm going to go bounce in it.

296
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:50,419
You're supposed to take your shoes off before you go in there.

297
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:54,419
You know what?

298
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:57,419
I'm stressed about my daughter's birthday party.

299
00:11:57,419 --> 00:11:59,419
I don't need your attitude.

300
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,419
Well, I will do the hard on this, and you haven't even said thank you.

301
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:04,419
Oh, I'm sorry, thank you.

302
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:07,419
Thank you for blaming me for everything that's wrong in your life.

303
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:10,419
Thank you for walking out on our friendship.

304
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:11,419
You are welcome.

305
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:14,419
And thank you for mocking me for all of these years.

306
00:12:14,419 --> 00:12:17,419
And for making it so easy.

307
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:19,419
Why are you being such a jerk?

308
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:23,419
Because you're my best friend, and you hurt my feelings.

309
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:26,419
Well, you're my best friend, you hurt my feelings.

310
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:31,419
I can't believe you shut me.

311
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,419
I can't believe you shut me.

312
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:37,419
But it was kind of fun, wasn't it?

313
00:12:37,419 --> 00:12:38,419
It was. Do it again.

314
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:39,419
Gladly.

315
00:12:40,419 --> 00:12:42,419
Oh, yeah, now the same time.

316
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:46,419
Oh, it's awesome.

317
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,419
Yeah, okay, this time, knees, then feet.

318
00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,419
One, two, three.

319
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,419
Sorry if it's weird, Cheldon made me best man instead of you.

320
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:58,419
It's okay. I was best man for two whole days.

321
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:03,419
No one can take that away from me.

322
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:06,419
Tipford, Cheldon, when he did.

323
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:11,419
Although if you want to be a part of the wedding party,

324
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:14,419
I suppose you could be the flower girl.

325
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:17,419
Sold.

326
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:22,419
But I thought Hallie was going to be the flower girl.

327
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,419
Oh, that's much better. Sorry, Stuart, you're out.

328
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:30,419
Hey, so it's Bernadette, okay, with me being made of honor.

329
00:13:30,419 --> 00:13:33,419
Actually, I haven't had the courage to tell her.

330
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,419
I guess I should do that.

331
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,419
Oh, yeah.

332
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,419
Although as made of honor, your job is to make my life easier.

333
00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:46,419
Damn it.

334
00:13:46,419 --> 00:13:48,419
Hey, Stuart, you still want in on this wedding?

335
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:53,419
Not that much.

336
00:13:55,419 --> 00:13:57,419
Fine, I'll do it.

337
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,419
But do me a favor and unlock the liquor cabinet first.

338
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:04,419
Scratch paper, check. Whiteboard, check.

339
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:06,419
Check, mix, check.

340
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,419
And here we go.

341
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,419
Dang it.

342
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:16,419
Hello, mother.

343
00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:17,419
Hi there, Shelley.

344
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:21,419
You will never believe who I ran into at the barbecue festival.

345
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,419
I am right in the middle of some very important work.

346
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,419
I don't have time for this right now.

347
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:28,419
Then why did you answer the phone?

348
00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,419
Because you raised me to be polite.

349
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:31,419
Now stop bothering me.

350
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,259
Either anybody

351
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:46,419
or somebody else than her.

352
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:03,419
Hello again.

353
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:06,419
Who did you see at the barbecue festival?

354
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:08,419
Mr. Watkins.

355
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,419
Really? You called me and interrupted my work to tell me

356
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,419
that you ran into somebody you could plausibly run into.

357
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:17,419
I'm sorry, mother. I really need to focus here.

358
00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:19,419
I will speak to you next week.

359
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,419
Okay, sweetheart. I'll talk to you then.

360
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:32,419
I thought Mr. Watkins moved to Florida.

361
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:35,419
He did. He was back visiting his son.

362
00:15:35,419 --> 00:15:38,419
Oh, gosh darn it. That is interesting.

363
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:40,419
Was it Tommy or Joe? I bet it was Joe,

364
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,419
because he and Tommy had a falling out of that time share.

365
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:50,419
Okay. I'm really uncomfortable with him back in that room.

366
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:52,419
Why? Has it made a people day?

367
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:55,419
You don't get it all the years that we lived together.

368
00:15:55,419 --> 00:15:57,419
He drove me crazy the whole time.

369
00:15:57,419 --> 00:15:59,419
And now he's not.

370
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:02,419
Exactly.

371
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:06,419
Look at me like that. It means he did it on purpose.

372
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:08,419
It was a choice.

373
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:13,419
That's like fighting out Godzilla could have had Arbise instead of Tokyo.

374
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:16,419
I don't think they have Arbise in Japan.

375
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:20,419
Not my point.

376
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:23,419
Sheldon.

377
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,419
Sheldon.

378
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:29,419
Sheldon.

379
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:32,419
Sorry, am I being too loud?

380
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:35,419
No, you're being perfect and you know it.

381
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:39,419
Would you like me to be a less considerate tenant?

382
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:45,419
No. Yes. Stop messing with me.

383
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:52,419
Hey, I was wrong. There's an Arbise in Okinawa.

384
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,419
No Marisa. How did you guys meet?

385
00:16:55,419 --> 00:17:03,419
Oh, it's a pretty funny story. We met in a bookstore.

386
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:06,420
That is funny.

387
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,420
Yeah, I was just there using the bathroom.

388
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,420
But this one had a stack of books like this doll.

389
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,420
Oh, I see you really like to read.

390
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Oh no, I work there.

391
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,420
Yeah, she is super smart.

392
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,420
Seriously, you name like any book?

393
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,420
She'll tell you if she's heard of it.

394
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Go on, try her.

395
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,420
Oh, uh, uh, uh, catch her on the ride.

396
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
Nope.

397
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,420
Look at that, Penny. I guess we both like nerds.

398
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:35,420
So, uh, can I take this thing out?

399
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,420
No, it's a little choppy tonight.

400
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Yeah, that's okay. This is nice sitting under the stars.

401
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
It's actually kind of peaceful.

402
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
Well, it's a beautiful boat.

403
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Thanks, man. We love it.

404
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,420
Although he's so tall, he bends his head almost every time he goes downstairs.

405
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,420
After the first couple, you don't even feel it.

406
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,420
Where are our manners?

407
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,420
Zach, let's get our guests something to drink.

408
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Got it, babe.

409
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,420
You can't believe that guy's rich.

410
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,420
What's your head?

411
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,420
That was a close one.

412
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,420
Are you jealous?

413
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,420
I know, I know. I shouldn't be. He's super sweet.

414
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:10,420
I should be happy for them.

415
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
What's driving me crazy, too?

416
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Really?

417
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Yeah, so I was trying to pretend like it wasn't,

418
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
so you wouldn't think that was petty.

419
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,420
What? It turns out we're both petty.

420
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
I love you so much.

421
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Oh, it's freezing out here.

422
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Do you like me to eat things up?

423
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:30,420
No, I want to get into hot tub before I lose a toe.

424
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Oh, petty's bright.

425
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:36,420
Yeah, a new neighbor put in floodlights.

426
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,420
So, shall we?

427
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,420
I know what I take my robe off under a spotlight.

428
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,420
This is a candle body.

429
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,420
County neighbors, we haven't met yet. I'm Andy.

430
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
Oh, hello. Nice to meet you.

431
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:54,420
You know, your new balcony kind of looks right over our fence.

432
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,420
You might want to put up some trees.

433
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,420
We can see everything.

434
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,420
You can, but it's okay if you don't.

435
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
So, can you turn your lights off?

436
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Sorry, they're motion censored.

437
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Go off in a minute. Just try to stay still.

438
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,420
What are we going to do about this?

439
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,420
I say we wait until his lights go off,

440
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:21,420
and then I make hot, motionless love to you.

441
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:28,420
Don't move. It's go time.

442
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,420
Hello, I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

443
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
And I'm Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler.

444
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,420
And this is Dr. Sheldon Cooper and Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler present

445
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,420
Dr. Sheldon Cooper's fun with flags.

446
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,420
I'd like to start this episode by apologizing on behalf of Dr. Farrah Fowler.

447
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,420
He made the wild claim last week that there was no national tri-colored flag

448
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
with a purple stripe.

449
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,420
When, in fact, the Estonian governor at Inside the Russian Empire

450
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:57,420
had a purple stripe on their flag from 1721 to 1917.

451
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,420
See? Right there in the middle.

452
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,420
And I'd like to apologize on behalf of Dr. Cooper

453
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:12,420
for having his zipper down for the entire segment on the flags of East Africa.

454
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,420
Sorry, Tanzania, you deserve better.

455
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Okay, that's my dad.

456
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,420
Remember, do you not bring up any baby stuff, right?

457
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,420
Not me not one in one, not you having one with Zach?

458
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,420
Got it.

459
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,420
And if he brings up, change your subject to literally anything else.

460
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
I got it.

461
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,420
But not the corn huskers. Do not discuss the corn huskers.

462
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,420
Is that a sports team?

463
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Never mind, you're good.

464
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,420
Bye!

465
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,420
Hey, why it?

466
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,420
Hey, it's a hell of a handshake.

467
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:45,420
Oh, well, I haven't been taking vitamins.

468
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,420
Dad, come on in, sit down.

469
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,420
Gonna give you something to drink? Maybe a beer?

470
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,420
Sure, if you're having one.

471
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:55,420
Why wouldn't you, since you're not pregnant?

472
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,420
Um, Leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend Zach.

473
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,420
How about those corn huskers?

474
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,420
Amy is the one constant I can count on, and now she's changing.

475
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,420
It's just a haircut and some clothes.

476
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,420
No, it's a last straw. I can't take any more.

477
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,420
You and Belira, they finally fixed the elevator.

478
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
This is a nightmare.

479
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
What's with him?

480
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,420
He want to know Belle Pryzen, his wife looks amazing.

481
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Oh, yeah, got it.

482
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,420
How did you get down here?

483
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,420
Elevator, it's really fast.

484
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,420
I need to be alone right now. Don't try to follow me.

485
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
All right, you need a ride?

486
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
That'd be great, thank you.

487
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Where's Raj?

488
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,420
He's working with Bert.

489
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,420
They're probably cutting their stupid meteorite open with their stupid diamonds up.

490
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
Are you okay?

491
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,420
Yeah, I'm numb just a little rundown. It might be a head cold.

492
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,420
Pyrr-L.

493
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,420
Pyrr-L.

494
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:31,420
Pyrr-L.

495
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
Pyrr-L.

496
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
Can I top anybody off?

497
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,420
Why don't you go to bed, I'll run out and get you some medicine.

498
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:46,420
It's okay, Stuart gave me someone else at the comic book store.

499
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,420
Really, you're taking medicine from Stuart?

500
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,420
Doesn't need like all of it.

501
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,420
He's got plenty, his pillcats, he's like this big.

502
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,420
All right, why don't you go to bed, I'll sleep out of here on the couch.

503
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,420
No, no, no, you take the bed, I'll stay out here.

504
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:04,420
Even better, sweet dreams, not bag.

505
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,420
Go away, Raj.

506
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
What are you doing?

507
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,420
I'm winning you bag love, actually, Stiles.

508
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,420
I don't know what that means.

509
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:30,420
Really? You've never seen love, actually?

510
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,420
If you want to watch it right now, I'll just wait.

511
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,420
I have nothing to say to you.

512
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,420
Look, we both made mistakes.

513
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:44,420
I am so sorry that I spied on you, I didn't mean to, but I know it's not okay.

514
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,420
Now, do you want to apologize to me?

515
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,420
You also said you don't trust me and that you barely know me.

516
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,420
I really thought this would be more of a back and forth thing.

517
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,420
Okay.

518
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,420
Amy?

519
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Yeah.

520
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
There's something out here.

521
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,420
Just trap it under a cup and I'll be there in a minute.

522
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,420
I'll try, but it's Leonard.

523
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,420
I know it all feels overwhelming right now, but I promise you things will settle down.

524
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,420
There's no oral grade, you filthy liar.

525
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,420
Hey, Spenny Hill?

526
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
No, why?

527
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,420
I wanted to show him my latest creation.

528
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,420
I give you...

529
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Dr. Amy Farah Fowler.

530
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,420
Wow.

531
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:00,420
Amy, you look amazing.

532
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,420
Thank you.

533
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,420
Sheldon, what do you think?

534
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,420
I like you better the way you were.

535
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:15,420
But she looks beautiful.

536
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:19,420
Classic lines, colors that compliment her skin tone,

537
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,420
and hair that goes from office to on the town in minutes.

538
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,420
I don't care, put it back.

539
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,420
I like the way I look.

540
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Well, I don't.

541
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,420
My fault, I was out of her own gray.

542
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:38,420
I'm new a giant metal door.

543
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:41,420
I check the door for traps.

544
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
There are no traps.

545
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,420
I use my wizard eye to see what's on the other side of the door.

546
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:52,420
Hey, that's sort of like how you used a doorbell camera to spy on your fiance.

547
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
It's nothing like that.

548
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
Your wizard eye reveals a monster.

549
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,420
Is it alone and unloved?

550
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,420
I guess I open the door and say, hey, Raj!

551
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,420
Why don't you just call her?

552
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
I'm sure you guys can work this out.

553
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,420
I don't want to talk about it.

554
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Let's just play.

555
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,420
Okay, the sideclaps tells you that the enchantress you seek is staying at the end of the dwarven lords.

556
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,420
I'd really un-in.

557
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
All I knew was a concierge at a hotel.

558
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,420
That's a little insensitive, don't you think?

559
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
I had to notice that before you mentioned it.

560
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,420
You were now that I've mentioned it. How do you feel?

561
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
Bad.

562
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,420
Shame on you.

563
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:30,420
Zach wanted you to donate your genetic material for his baby.

564
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,420
Yeah.

565
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:36,420
So I'd be helping out a couple who really want a baby and they were going to pay us and Penny freaked out about it.

566
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
That doesn't make any sense.

567
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,420
They wanted you?

568
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,420
Yes, children.

569
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,420
They wanted me.

570
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,420
I'm smart, I'm nice.

571
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
I'm smart, I'm nice.

572
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,420
And I can eat cheese without clearing out a room.

573
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
Are you upset he didn't ask you?

574
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:58,420
Of course not. I just think it's interesting that of all the people he knows he thinks you're the best choice.

575
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,420
Well, he does.

576
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,420
I don't see why Penny is so against this.

577
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:11,420
Perhaps Penny is worried that you haven't considered the emotional toll of knowing there's a child out there who is biologically yours but not actually yours.

578
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,420
Oh, that's really insightful.

579
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Yeah, I'm taller than you and I don't have asthma.

580
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
People are crazy.

581
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:22,420
I can't believe they're going to cut that with this punk ass diamond saw.

582
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,420
And then what are you doing?

583
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Showing you that this is the better way.

584
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:48,420
Oh, what ever's inside there is dangerous.

585
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
Oh, and pretty.

586
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,420
What is that?

587
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Ah!

588
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
Are you okay?

589
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
Ah, yeah, I'm fine.

590
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,420
I'm just feeling a little...

591
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,420
Hungry.

592
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,420
No!

593
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Stop eating butt!

594
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
Keep eating butt!

595
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,420
Leonard, Leonard!

596
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
What? What?

597
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
You're having a bad dream.

598
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Oh, thank God.

599
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,420
I was eating my friends. Well, one friend and one acquaintance.

600
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
That's either what birds are okay, two friends.

601
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,420
Let me see if you're running in a fever.

602
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,420
Oh, yeah, you're burning up.

603
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
Are you okay?

604
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
It depends.

605
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420
What will look?

606
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,420
Color in my eyes.

607
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,420
I don't know. Brown? No, green.

608
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,420
No wait, brown.

609
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,420
Oh, good, I'm awake.

610
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,420
Oh, good, you're here. Are you still fighting?

611
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:06,420
If you get divorced, do I get two chrispuses?

612
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,420
We're not getting divorced.

613
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,420
Listen, we realized that we're facing some new challenges as a married couple.

614
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,420
Yeah, and there are a few things we need to stay on top of.

615
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,420
So we thought it would be useful.

616
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,420
I can't believe I am about to say this.

617
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,420
Would you please help us make a relationship agreement?

618
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,420
But one that's tailored to us, okay, we don't need a bathroom schedule.

619
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,420
Although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance.

620
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
What do you say?

621
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,420
I get to write a contract.

622
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,420
I say let's get this party of the first part started.

623
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
You really think that's funny?

624
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
It's an R agreement I have to laugh.

625
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Oh, that's a nice one.

626
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
Was it yours when you were little?

627
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
My dad built it for me.

628
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
Wow, it's so cute.

629
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
This was the husband, this was the wife.

630
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
They'd go out on adventures together.

631
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
Cruises, skiing, horseback riding.

632
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
That was really me just duct-taping them to our dog.

633
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
And did they have kids?

634
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
He did.

635
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,420
But the mommy and daddy didn't like them, so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoebox.

636
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
Yeah, that's not worrisome at all.

637
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,420
Every girl dreams about being a mom.

638
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Sometimes you think you're never going to have kids.

639
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
And one day you wake up and you're pregnant.

640
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
And it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now.

641
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
And they're doing your husband never even got to go anywhere.

642
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,420
I don't even care to a dog.

643
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
I skipped spin class for this.

644
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
It's going to be a while.

645
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,420
Well, first deliverers can be slow.

646
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,420
I'm trying to rethink the flash onesie I bought this kid.

647
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,420
I found it but it's empty.

648
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
Well, it doesn't matter. We're not going to the hospital now.

649
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,420
Are you sure I'd really like to?

650
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,420
Well, should we, uh, head back up?

651
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Well, guys, we're all awake. Why don't we go to a diner or something?

652
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,420
Oh, uh, I don't know.

653
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
Sheldon, you don't want to do that, do you?

654
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,420
Doesn't matter what I want. It's your birthday. You decide.

655
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,420
Oh, my God, it's your birthday. What's just something fun?

656
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Uh, we go to a bar? Well.

657
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Okay, I can breathe again. Maybe they want to have sex.

658
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,420
Oh, of course. The annual birthday booty spectacular.

659
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,420
That's a bit childish, isn't it?

660
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,420
I'm sorry, and what flavor is your bubblegum cigar?

661
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,420
Great. I find it the most mild.

662
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:43,420
All right, will you two go have fun?

663
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,420
If we find my backup in hailer, maybe we can get frisky.

664
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Oh, you sexy, weezy little man.

665
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,420
Would you look at that?

666
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:59,420
The image we gave it was 45% white noise, and it's still managed to reconstruct it.

667
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,420
I've never seen results like this before.

668
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,420
No, we need to stop from magnets on the way home. This is going right on the fridge.

669
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Aren't you glad you participated in this?

670
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Well, I am. And you realize what the next step is.

671
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,420
Set up a second culture and try to replicate our results.

672
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Uh, no. We lock that door, lower our underpants a little and make a baby.

673
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Make a baby? What are you talking about?

674
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Clearly the combination of our DNA is exceptional.

675
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,420
But our child could be the next step in the evolution of mankind.

676
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,420
We'll be able to get in any free school we want.

677
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
She's shelled and I'm not ready to have a baby.

678
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:45,420
Oh, yes you are. I track your cycle.

679
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,420
For the next 36 hours, you're as fertile as a manure-covered wheat field.

680
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Wow, I can actually feel the egg crawling its way back up.

681
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
Hello.

682
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
I'm looking for Howard Woolowitz.

683
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
Howard Woolowitz?

684
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
I have the right address, don't I?

685
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,420
Address?

686
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,420
Is he here?

687
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,420
Uh, no.

688
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Do you know where I can find him?

689
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Me, I ask what this is about.

690
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
No, you may not.

691
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
I'll get you out.

692
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Have him call me.

693
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Okay.

694
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Raj, who's at the door?

695
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,420
That's not him.

696
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,420
I wonder if this is what it feels like to be Bunnett's baby.

697
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:55,420
I don't know. Bernard's baby doesn't have a jacuzzi jet hitting just the right spot.

698
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Those jets are for my secret spot, not his.

699
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
What are you doing here?

700
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:09,420
It's called relaxing and that's all you need to know.

701
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,420
Well, it's getting late.

702
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
Maybe we should head home.

703
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
Yeah.

704
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Probably right.

705
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
You coming?

706
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,420
Yeah, just give me a minute.

707
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
Why?

708
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
You know how you're wearing a bathing suit?

709
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
Yeah?

710
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
I kind of went the other way.

711
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
You jacuzzi fire some hot tub!

712
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
You make God sad today, Mom.

713
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,420
Sheldon, they haven't done anything wrong. I think it's nice they're hitting it off.

714
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,420
What's the other reason to rush in to anything?

715
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,420
Look at us. We shut things remarkably slow.

716
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
We didn't even hold hands for two years.

717
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
It's a lot hotter than it sounds.

718
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,420
You're a patient young lady.

719
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,420
Hey, she's mine. Take a cold shower, Grandpa.

720
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,420
There's a lot of traffic. Are we going to be okay?

721
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,420
You'll be at the airport an hour before your flight.

722
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,420
Good. Thank you.

723
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,420
Plenty of time for you to meet another Jerry Attrick boy toy.

724
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,420
Hey, I will not have you be disrespectful to me.

725
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,420
Yes, ma'am.

726
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Sheldon, your mother's an attractive woman.

727
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,420
You need to get used to the fact that men are going to be interested in her.

728
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,420
And you need to drive the car and mind your business.

729
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,420
I will not have you be disrespectful to me.

730
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Well, you're not my mother.

731
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
Don't you be disrespectful to her?

732
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,420
Yes, ma'am.

733
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,420
You'll get there. You just gotta put some zing on it.

734
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:53,420
I'll make you a deal. 30 years from now, if you're still single and things don't work out with me and Bernadette,

735
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,420
you and I can give it a go.

736
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,420
I appreciate your offer, but if things don't work out with you too, I'm swooping in on her like a vulture.

737
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
Too late, still recalled dibs.

738
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,420
But theoretically, if you and I were in a gay relationship, how would we tell people?

739
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,420
Like, bring up announcements?

740
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,420
I don't know. What difference does it make?

741
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:19,420
Well, I want to make sure we get invited to all the parades.

742
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,420
That was still a fun.

743
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,420
Yeah, well, if you want to march in a fishnet crop top, you better lay off that dip.

744
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,420
You don't want me to eat it, why'd you put it out?

745
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:33,420
Just for the girls, they broke up with me. I don't care if they get fat.

746
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm not gonna get fat.

747
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,420
You want a bet? You never exercise.

748
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,420
Fine. Look, I'll exercise right now.

749
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,420
What?

750
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
These are crunches, by the way.

751
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Very mature. Keep eating like that. You're gonna have a heart attack.

752
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
Okay. How about if I eat like this?

753
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
Mmm.

754
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
You're such a child.

755
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Hey, is that any way to talk to your future husband?

756
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
Hey, I was being hypothetical, okay? I would never marry you.

757
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
Please, when you see the ring I pick out, you're gonna melt.

758
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
Yeah, right.

759
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
Wait, is it Rose Gold? Actually, don't tell me I want to be surprised.

760
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
I'm only living together, kills the romance.

761
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,420
Okay, you guys had sex one whole time. Nothing can put out a fire like that.

762
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,420
But what happens when we each get a peek behind the curtain?

763
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,420
She's never even seen me unshaving.

764
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:33,420
Just shaved yesterday, you're good for three months.

765
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,420
Sheldon, I understand your apprehension, but let me appeal to the scientist in you.

766
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:43,420
Given the five-week end date, isn't it the perfect opportunity to consider this an experiment

767
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,420
and collect data on our compatibility?

768
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,420
Don't try luring me in with sexy talk.

769
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,420
Okay.

770
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,420
Start, check the original series. The Enterprise was on a five-year mission to explore new worlds.

771
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,420
Think of this as your personal five-week mission to do the same.

772
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
If you want to luring me in with sexy talk, that's how you do it.

773
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,420
Don't be proud of that.

774
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Welcome.

775
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,420
What is this?

776
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, well, you said you didn't have time to go out for dinner, so I thought we could have one right here.

777
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,420
All right, Jason.

778
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,420
Come on, we're at the tennis court room. It'll be like dining under the stars.

779
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,420
You see this double zero? When it says zero-one, that means it's twinkling.

780
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,420
Sometimes it takes a while.

781
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,420
This is so sweet, but you know I'm working.

782
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,420
That's why I already cleaned up in here and all the other rooms in the hall.

783
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,420
Well, I suppose that gives me a little time.

784
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,420
Oh, this is it.

785
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,420
I tried to cook you a meal from your homeland.

786
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Oh, really? You made Cuban food?

787
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,420
That depends. Do they have Mexican food in Cuba?

788
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
We'll get the curb out. You can take it for a test drive.

789
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,420
I'm telling you. This mayhem is gonna be...

790
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,420
Oh, is it your bar?

791
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Yeah. Oh. Anyway, let's just get in and see if the GPS can take us to the nearest emergency room.

792
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,420
What was I thinking?

793
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,420
Well, all the witches are not a lifting people. We tip the lifting people.

794
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
Do we really have to sit for hours in the emergency room?

795
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,420
They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.

796
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,420
You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair.

797
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:49,420
Which by the way, was bit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.

798
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,420
Fine, we'll go to the ER. Just stop selling me on the van.

799
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:55,420
You're right. It sells itself.

800
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
You have to admit it's a pretty smooth ride.

801
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
I was hoping it'd be quieter.

802
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:05,420
You childbirth is half this bad. You are so screwed!

803
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:14,420
Hey, so we've been talking and if you need a place to stay, we'd be happy to fix up the garage for you.

804
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
That would be amazing!

805
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,420
I was literally just looking at my moving boxes trying to pick one to live in.

806
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:25,420
I know it's not ideal, but you'd have plenty of space for your furniture.

807
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,420
And there's this cool button that makes an entire wall go up and down.

808
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
I cannot thank you enough.

809
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,420
It is our pleasure.

810
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,420
Hey, can you hold on one sec?

811
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,420
Hello?

812
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,420
Hey buddy, are you still looking for a place to live?

813
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,420
Yeah, why'd you ask?

814
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,420
You know, we have the extra bedroom and if you needed it's doors.

815
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
Oh my god, that's so generous!

816
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,420
At least we can do.

817
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:54,420
Bye, I really appreciate it. Can you hold on one second?

818
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,420
It's a Howard. What's the bathroom situation gonna be?

819
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Well, there's a sink out there that takes care of half your problems.

820
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,420
But I can use the downstairs bathroom, right?

821
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,420
Yeah, we barely use it, so it'll be like it's yours.

822
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Cool, cool. Yeah, hold on one second.

823
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
What?

824
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,420
Hey, what's it like sharing a bathroom with Benny?

825
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:22,420
Is the hair everywhere? Does she use your loofah?

826
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,420
I don't have a loofah.

827
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
Okay, well if I move in you can't use mine.

828
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
Hold on a second.

829
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Hey Howard, how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

830
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:37,420
I don't know, why are you asking all these questions?

831
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:41,420
Well, to be honest, Dennis is on the other line and he offered me this bedroom.

832
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
Great, go live there.

833
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:46,420
But you made the garage sound so fun.

834
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,420
I just didn't want you to feel bad about it.

835
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Unless Leonard's apartment also has a raccoon that chooses to weigh in on cold night, go there!

836
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
One second.

837
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
Okay, I think we're close.

838
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,420
How do you feel about a mini fridge in my room?

839
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,420
Hey pal, you want to live here or not?

840
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,420
Hi, Benny, yes please.

841
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Hey, what do you think we should open a show with?

842
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,420
The foreign doctor Jones or let's get astrophysical.

843
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,420
I think we should start with something that gets them up on their feet.

844
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
Maybe Sherlock around the clock.

845
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,420
Great, yeah, let's give it a try.

846
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,420
How is nothing keeping down?

847
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
Right, sorry.

848
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,420
It's cool, we don't need volume to rock.

849
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:37,420
Instead of blowing the roof of this place, we can gently lift it off and set it quietly down in the backyard.

850
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,420
Okay, on the...

851
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,420
On set to bottom, on bank street.

852
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,420
Come on, doctor.

853
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,420
Time to move the feet.

854
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
Sing it with us.

855
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:56,420
Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock, Sherlock around the clock.

856
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:02,420
We can't hear you Sherlock Sherlock Sherlock around the clock.

857
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,420
Nice going.

858
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Sorry, sorry, I'll get her.

859
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,420
One second.

860
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
You bought diapers, right?

861
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,420
Be right back.

862
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,420
Rock, I'm wrong.

863
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,420
They're remaking your show and they cast Will Wheaton as Professor Proton.

864
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:29,420
And the worst part is, he's not even a scientist.

865
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,420
No, the worst part is, I'm sitting on a moist log.

866
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,420
We have to stop this and protect your legacy.

867
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:42,420
What legacy?

868
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:47,420
My last two seasons, I was on Sunday morning at 5.30.

869
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:50,420
We would be by Davy and Goliath.

870
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,420
I can't believe you don't care.

871
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,420
Believe it.

872
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,420
Well, I care a lot and Will Wheaton grew the day he ever met me.

873
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:08,420
I think that's true of most people.

874
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,420
Sometimes Amy doesn't do things because she's worried about how I'll react.

875
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,420
First of all, it's not sometimes it's always.

876
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,420
Second, it's not Amy, it's everybody.

877
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,420
Third, it's not news, it's well established.

878
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:29,420
Yeah, like just now I wanted to get a croissant but I didn't want to hear you say Ula-la.

879
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,420
So you're saying everyone walks on eggshells to spare my feelings?

880
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:40,420
No, of course not because we don't want to hear you complain about how much you hate the sound of crunching eggshells.

881
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,420
Why don't my relationship with Amy to be like that?

882
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,420
Sheldon, Amy knew what she was getting into.

883
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,420
You think?

884
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,420
Yes, we warned her.

885
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
Well, regardless, I can change.

886
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,420
Yeah, of course you do.

887
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
Yeah, everybody thinks I'm so predictable.

888
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:04,420
Well, tomorrow, I'm going to show up at work and do something no one will expect.

889
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:06,420
We're a baseball cap backwards to prove your point.

890
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,420
Yes, but which hat?

891
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:16,420
Riffindle.

892
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,420
We know that you guess and I'm not going to do it.

893
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,420
Yeah, you will.

894
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:24,420
Yeah.

895
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,420
I just talked to Sheldon, he apologized about the tests and asked me to be his best man.

896
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,420
Great, after all you've done for him, he should have asked you.

897
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,420
And Amy's your best friend, I'm sure she'll come to her senses and pick you.

898
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,420
Okay, she's not my best friend, we're not 12.

899
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,420
She wants Bernadette to be her maid of honor, I really don't care.

900
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:41,420
Sounds like you care.

901
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:43,420
No, I mean, it's just annoying.

902
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,420
You know, we talk every day, we see each other all the time, she's always there for me, and basically, oh my god, Amy's my best friend.

903
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,420
You okay?

904
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,420
No, my best friend didn't ask me to be her maid of honor, I'm pissed!

905
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:09,420
So, bottom line, what you did was wrong and cruel, which the mother of my children finds oddly appealing.

906
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,420
So, she still wants to be my maid of honor?

907
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,420
Made of honor, hit woman, whatever you need, make the call.

908
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:25,420
Look, I know this is your wedding and you can do whatever you want, but if you think anyone but me is going to be your maid of honor, then you're an idiot, because you are my best friend.

909
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,420
Too late, Bernadette.

910
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,420
Bestie!
