1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What do you call an Asian Dwayne Johnson?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The walk.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hey.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Hi, killer.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, fuck.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What's this?

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Food.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oh, my God.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Great.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Another girl rejecting me, great.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Hey, you lost your chance of being my soulmate.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Is this you morning?

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, it was another soulmate as well, but we don't have to talk about it.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
How have you been?

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You've been good?

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm great.

19
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You look beautiful.

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thank you.

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, it's now.

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
All right.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is paper rock.

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, it's paper rock.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This is paper rock.

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is paper rock.

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
This is paper rock.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
This is paper rock.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Oh, my God, we're so in secret.

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, we're not.

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is paper rock.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
This is paper rock.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yeah, you can go first.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't kill this VL for the same wrong.

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
She's got stone.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They say an apple a day keeps the doctor away.

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Not the doctor that was fucking my girlfriend.

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I don't think it was a real doctor, I think.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, what do you...

40
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fuck me.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't eat apples anymore.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Sorry.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
What do you call a woman who loves small dicks?

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sam?

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Please be Sam.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Oh, that's me.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah.

48
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What's the answer, Sam?

49
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hope for your girlfriend.

50
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
My girlfriend.

51
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, I know.

52
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's what I don't know.

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I was just...

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, fuck.

55
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, okay.

56
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hello.

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hi.

58
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You know, boyfriends are like a box of chocolates.

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They will kill your dog.

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm just joking around.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm joking.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
My girlfriend's dog died, you know, so I got her another one.

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
She's like, what am I supposed to do with two dead dogs?

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm just joking around.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm just joking around.

66
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, yeah.

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Oh, yeah.

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, yeah.

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm joking around.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
It's all right.

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Oh, yeah.

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh, yeah.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, yeah.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Oh, take it.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, it remind me of who kicked my dog.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I didn't know.

77
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I didn't know.

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I didn't know.

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I didn't know.

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

81
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, fuck.

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You want to do the accent again?

83
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You want to gas?

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Just do the accent.

85
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Bro, what project?

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I want to play a good play-due, bro.

87
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No, so say I'm pleased with the spirit.

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We edited it out.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
No, put it in.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You know what I said?

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Is there any...

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She's got it.

93
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're great.

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Do I do?

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,439
I didn't hear it.

96
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:35,400
You have my permission.

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,039
I have permission from some part of you.

98
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,280
Fucking just over.

99
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,719
Who kicked my dog?

100
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,360
It's not Razor because it's such a bad impression.

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,759
It's good.

102
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,759
It's good.

103
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,759
It's good.

104
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,759
What?

105
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:54,159
Sad leader.

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
You kicked my dog.

107
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,639
It's not a bad impression.

108
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,439
It's not the same joke.

109
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
Yeah, it's good.

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,439
It's good.

111
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,439
Is my good?

112
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,439
Okay.

113
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,439
What do you call a horny cow?

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,439
What?

115
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,439
Beef jerky.

116
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:14,439
I sucked it back up.

117
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:15,439
Fuck!

118
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,439
What do you want?

119
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,439
Oh my god.

120
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:23,439
My, erm...

121
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,439
My girlfriend left me because she caught me in bed with some pasta.

122
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:35,439
I've been feeling cannelloni.

123
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:42,439
I mean to some weird stuff, some fetishini.

124
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,439
Yes!

125
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:53,439
I wrote an anti-capitalist pasta sauce book, The Communist Manipesto.

126
00:04:54,439 --> 00:05:00,439
You're so good.

127
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:07,439
I've been trying.

128
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:15,439
I'm killing all of you.

129
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:22,439
Karen.

130
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:29,439
I'm just calling you Karen.

131
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:36,439
I don't want this in the edit.

132
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:40,439
Oh my god.

133
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:41,439
Oh my god.

134
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:42,439
Oh my god.

135
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:43,439
Oh my god.

136
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
Oh my god.

137
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,439
Oh my god.

138
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:46,439
Oh my god.

139
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,439
Oh my god.

140
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,439
Hammy, we've done like three blocks.

141
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:53,439
It's all one block.

142
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,439
Who, who what?

143
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,439
Mark.

144
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,439
He's definitely not by way.

145
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,439
What do you call an Asian dwayne Johnson?

146
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:03,439
What?

147
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,439
The walk.

148
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,439
Erm, that's funny.

149
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,439
That's funny.

150
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,439
Yeah.

151
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:15,439
Keep doing the race, don't.

152
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,439
See what happens.

153
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,439
You got the drink sandwich.

154
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,439
You just did little chicken slap.

155
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,439
Little people.

156
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,439
Little people.

157
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:27,439
Little people.

158
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,439
God, this table is gross.

159
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,439
Is yours full of alcohol?

160
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,439
It's empty.

161
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:35,439
Would you like some?

162
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,439
I'm okay.

163
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:39,439
You know what?

164
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,439
I'm glad my girlfriend broke up with me.

165
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,439
Yeah.

166
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,439
My girlfriend, Lorraine.

167
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:48,439
You know, because I can see this other girl,

168
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:49,439
her name's Claire Rake.

169
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,439
Fuck.

170
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:53,439
I mean, you know what?

171
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,439
I'm glad.

172
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,439
You know what?

173
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,439
I'm glad my girlfriend, erm,

174
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:00,439
Lorraine broke up with me.

175
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:02,439
Because I can see Claire Lee now.

176
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,439
She's better, you know?

177
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:07,439
I can see Claire Lee now.

178
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,439
Lorraine is gone.

179
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,439
Oh my god.

180
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,439
Oh my god.

181
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,439
Oh my god.

182
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,439
I can see you.

183
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:18,439
He wasn't worth it.

184
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,439
He wasn't worth it.

185
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,439
Yeah, drink.

186
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,439
I don't know you do all of you know yet.

187
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,439
Yeah, this is kind of good for him.

188
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,439
Yeah, like what is the best for him?

189
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:30,439
Well, he's already emo now.

190
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,439
He can bring him down.

191
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:32,439
It will be deep.

192
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,439
Like the cup.

193
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:36,439
He was so come back to it.

194
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:41,439
They say rejection is a hard pill to swallow.

195
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:46,439
But it's just practice for the 60 pills later.

196
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,439
Oh shit.

197
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:50,439
Oh my god.

198
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:52,439
That's the kind of thing.

199
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,439
Oh my god.

200
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,439
Don't worry, calm my dance deep rejection.

201
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,439
Rose is a red violet, so blue.

202
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,439
My girlfriend's front door.

203
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,439
I left a poo.

204
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,439
And that's my uncle, our poo.

205
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,439
Dinesh is cousin.

206
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,439
Didn't help with the girlfriend's situation, but.

207
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,439
Sticky situation.

208
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:21,439
Sticky situation.

209
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,439
You go for a third shot.

210
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,439
Yeah, I don't laugh.

211
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,439
I don't know why you bought this chocolate.

212
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,439
Oh, sorry.

213
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:29,439
But, you eat it up.

214
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,439
Cheers.

215
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,439
Here we are.

216
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,440
What's your candle?

217
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
It's the lid, Abby.

218
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
It's filled in dead jokes.

219
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,440
Why do emo kids?

220
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,440
Why do you eat my poop?

221
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,440
Are you cheating again?

222
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
Cheating.

223
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
Just like her.

224
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,440
Sorry.

225
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Why do emo kids hate high fives?

226
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,440
Why?

227
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
Because they're always left hanging.

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
What?

229
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,440
What?

230
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
What's so dark?

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,440
You know, my girlfriend and I, we had something special, you know?

232
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,440
The first time I said I loved her, everything changed.

233
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Her name, her address, the locks on her doors.

234
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
A tender.

235
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
A tender.

236
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
I love they, them.

237
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Cheers.

238
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Cheers.

239
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
Cheers.

240
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
Cheers.

241
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
Cheers.

242
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Cheers.

243
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
Cheers.

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Cheers.

245
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Oh my god.

246
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,440
All right, let's fucking see what you come up with.

247
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
You fucking dead jokes, bro.

248
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,440
What the fuck?

249
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
This is too light-brap for me.

250
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Oh my god.

251
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
I'll tell them all these.

252
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
You'll be all news.

253
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
New brown king on the safe.

254
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Fuck.

255
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,440
Why?

256
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
So I'm gonna get this good.

257
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Get me good.

258
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Why don't Indians play soccer?

259
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Why?

260
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,440
Because every time they're out of corner, they open a store.

261
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Oh, it's like a Indians.

262
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
That's good stuff.

263
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
No.

264
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Just when you're dead, oh.

265
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,440
Oh, my god.

266
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Just when you're dead, oh.

267
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Just when you're dead, oh.

268
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
What?

269
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
What?

270
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
What?

271
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I feel like I'm dead.

272
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I'm so drunk.

273
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
I'm so drunk.

274
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
I'm so drunk.

275
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I'm so drunk.

276
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm so drunk.

277
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'm so drunk.

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Who's that?

279
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Who's that?

280
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,440
We heard about him.

281
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
Three of these.

282
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
No.

283
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
All right.

284
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
What is purple and red and goes round and around and around?

285
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Round and all.

286
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
No.

287
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
My dick.

288
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
When I put it in a blender.

289
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:47,440
I'm going through some of these.

290
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,440
Give me the towel.

291
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Where's that fuck fuck?

292
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,440
This will get him.

293
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Oh, it's good stuff right here.

294
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
It needs this one more thing.

295
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
A week.

296
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Oh, these are heavy hair, bro.

297
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Who doesn't have hair?

298
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
I don't see any food.

299
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
Oh.

300
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Don't be like the way that means to jump in.

301
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
Yeah.

302
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
That is so much fun.

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
It's all good.

304
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Like this.

305
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,440
Gotta go.

306
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,440
All right.

307
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
I don't know anymore.

308
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Oh, my gosh.

309
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
I can't believe you're right behind yourself.

310
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,440
I did.

311
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Thank you.

312
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm so obvious.

313
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,440
What's the difference between a sweet and an emo?

314
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
No.

315
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
A sweet is harder to cut.

316
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Think about it.

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
No, don't laugh.

318
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
I have more.

319
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Good.

320
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
This.

321
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Oh, no.

322
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
This.

323
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
This bald.

324
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
I'll look shot after.

325
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
This.

326
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
This.

327
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Take a breath.

328
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
All right.

329
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
You bet you're a penny guru.

330
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Man.

331
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
It's not good.

332
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
It's not good.

333
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I'll be honest, it's not good at all.

334
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
All right.

335
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I'll give you a blowjob and install all my money.

336
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
He said, you've been sucked by.

337
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
You've been sucked by.

338
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
I was moved.

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,440
Criminal.

340
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Oh.

341
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,440
I love this.

342
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
You were actually very good.

343
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
I feel like you should do the damn.

344
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
It's like proper.

345
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
That's not smooth, throw a good one.

346
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
No, like make one up.

347
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
I'll feel a joke.

348
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
It's not bad.

349
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
I'm angry with the president.

350
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
That's supposed to be jokes.

351
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Okay.

352
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,440
What's a condom and a coffin got in common?

353
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
What?

354
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,440
They both hold stiffs, but ones coming and ones going.

355
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

356
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,440
No, no, kill it with this weird look.

357
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
Is that supposed to be raisins?

358
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,440
What?

359
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
What?

360
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
What?

361
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,440
What?

362
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,440
What's a good news then?

363
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
It's like well.

364
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
I.

365
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,440
I, um.

366
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I bumped into the Channel 9 weatherman the other day.

367
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
And he's like, I've got some good news and I've got some bad news.

368
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
And I'm like, okay.

369
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,440
What's the bad news?

370
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
He's like, well, your girlfriend's having an affair.

371
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Okay.

372
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
What's the good news then?

373
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,760
It's like, well, it's clear skies for the rest of the day.

374
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,120
And I'm fucking your girlfriend.

375
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
Whoop-de-doo!

376
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,120
Oh!

377
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,760
Oh no!

378
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,160
Where the man is having sex with my girlfriend?

379
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,360
I got that.

380
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
I got some legal ones.

381
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,600
I got some good ones.

382
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
I got some good ones.

383
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Oh.

384
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,280
Where is my girlfriend?

385
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,440
I don't know why he put the girls to you.

386
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Yeah.

387
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,240
I got the rules.

388
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
I got the rules.

389
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,720
He gets coming up to the wrong.

390
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,400
Fuck yeah, I'll get to the wrong.

391
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:49,840
Oh, you have to send me up to this.

392
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,600
What's the difference between a penis and a bonus?

393
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,199
What?

394
00:15:56,199 --> 00:15:57,959
Your ex-girlfriend would have blown the bonus.

395
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:58,959
No.

396
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Yeah.

397
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
Oh, shit.

398
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,279
My granddad always said he was proud of me.

399
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:14,679
But I couldn't tell if he actually liked me.

400
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,199
Or whether he was because of my humongous

401
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,200
horse cock.

402
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Oh, fuck it.

403
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Oh, fuck it.

404
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Oh, shit.

405
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Oh, shit.

406
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
Oh, shit.

407
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
Oh, that's a weird.

408
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Yeah, and that's on the internet now.

409
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Anyone's gonna make fun of me?

410
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Yes.

411
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I need one who's gonna hook.

412
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
I'm gonna make more.

413
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Little day.

414
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Little day.

415
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
No, shit.

416
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
No.

417
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
No, I'm sorry.

418
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm sorry.

419
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Yeah.

420
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Yeah.

421
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah.

422
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,200
I'm sure.

423
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,200
Okay.

424
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,200
That'll help it.

425
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Yeah.

426
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
We just ended to Seth.

427
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Oh, yeah.

428
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
That was so weird.

429
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,200
It's a good one.

430
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,200
No, no, we need to go one.

431
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,200
I killed the one.

432
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
Woo!

433
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Great high five.

434
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
You should've.

435
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,200
I killed the one.

436
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Great high five.

437
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
You should've.

438
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,200
Oh.

439
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,200
I killed the one.

440
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,200
I killed the one.

441
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,200
I killed the one.

442
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,200
I killed the one.

443
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I killed the one.

444
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
It's gone.

445
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
Oh.

446
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,200
In the bitch.

447
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,200
Oh.

448
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Oh.

449
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh.
