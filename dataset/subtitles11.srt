1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
When we have a big star like you what we like to do is if there are fans of traveled

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,800
to give me the opportunity to ask some questions now

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,060
Who have I got first? I've got a looking for Victoria Campbell

But thank you

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,920
Have you really been interested? Have you really made a film about dolphins?

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,199
I did a documentary about dolphins. I got to swim with them in the open sea, which was pretty great

27
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,560
And there was I actually got bitten by a dolphin, which is hard to do

28
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,680
And the guy accused me of putting my finger in his blowhole. I went I

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,960
Know that's not good. That's not going up to someone on the street going man if I put my finger in your

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,199
Robin you and Mrs. Doubtfire were a tour de force of cross-dressing

You

39
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,800
I would say RuPaul to me is God's gift. I think if those of you don't know who RuPaul is imagine Kobe Bryant with tits

40
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:37,439
But I think that for me and a day medna for oh, yeah, pure pure comedy. Yes

41
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,919
I'm going to marry that's right. It's there in New Zealand. Yes

42
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:48,399

43
00:03:50,399 --> 00:03:52,399
Service

44
00:03:59,679 --> 00:04:04,479
Can we say whisked on BBC one I think you can't say whisked off. Oh that

45
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,919
It's like pissed off though. Oh

46
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,919
Yes

47
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,919
Minute in good night

48
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,759
Did you drive yourself here tonight? No

49
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,319
No, no, no, got my driving license. No, I'm still on driving me. Would you get in the car with them?

50
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:31,639
You're coming in your car when the black mariner

51
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,639
No

52
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:39,879
But now my husband is officially allowed to drive yes, I would get in a car with him

53
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,079
Only 61 years but I mean the terms of teaching you didn't know what before I was too pissed to drive

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,759
Okay, fair enough. Oh, no, we can go for my test and I'll go that's seeming I'll go

55
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,759
No, Mr. Osborne come back another day

56
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
I'm not even getting in the car

57
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,759
Walking on the test ended with a bottle of oak in my pocket in the car

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,159
Did you learn in a manual or an automatic? I can drive anything one of that a few trees

59
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,199
Anything you can use yet

60
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,879
Channel should move is there anything that can go on BBC one. Yeah, you just have a promotion. It's all DVD extras

61
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,599
You you're maize me you do you do you like a sort of Gordon Ramsay figure in my world. Thanks

62
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:52,039
You are so I don't know if you do you feel busy you seem incredibly busy

63
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:55,159
I pack a lot into the day. I suppose that is true. Yes

64
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,480
You do dramas travel documentaries books time consuming stuff. Yes, I'm

65
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,720
People seem surprised by but I think it is only because I'm hungry for it

66
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,879
If you are if you're anxious and keen to do things you do it when people say they're on to no fows in the day. It's never true

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Yeah

68
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,040
You have you have you have one of those brains that just absorbs things quite easily and retains

69
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,040
Tell you though

70
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:31,000
They're all kinds of things that everybody in this room knows that I'm completely ignorant this happened to me on

71
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,879
By the journalist the other day they said so what do you think about Katie Price?

72
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,720
When he said Jordan I did know I did know there was a woman called Jordan I'd heard of her

73
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,480
I didn't know I don't know who she is

74
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:54,400
That's the sort of ignorance that makes you seem even clever

75
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,439
But as a calu as a calu you've yourself yeah, and famously you were quite wild and in school and got expelled

76
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,120
Yes, and but you'd expect me a bill you're a bit of a swat

77
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:14,759
I was yes for many years. I was a swat you were good at everything. Yeah, I've found it quite easy

78
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,480
It came quite easily now. It's a affinity for languages and studying and I just didn't really take it seriously

79
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:25,319
And you'd quite a kind of juvenile obsession with drugs and things that could get you high

80
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,040
Yeah, well, that's right. There was always this myth that if you smoked nutmeg, you know

81
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,439
Get some sort of trip some hallucinous

82
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,660
So I got all the nutmeg out of the spice rack

83
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:41,319
Sort of put it into cigarette papers

84
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
I just got a rather sweet breath

85
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,180
And the other thing was dried bananas skin. Yes, there was this sort of this

86
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,240
It was a ludicrous there is nothing on this earth like I got now called in between us

87
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,360
You know that sort of age person when they solemnly go apparently

88
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,560
You can lean forward to get apparently and I had this one I heard apparently if you take the wax from a dog's ear

89
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,920
And you put it on like an argolid or an iron and you warm it up and you breathe in the fumes

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,120
It's like the most amazing high

91
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,079
Apparently, apparently you do

92
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,240
5% here is this true worth maybe more now 270 million dollars. I'm kind of been you know go up

93
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,720
Don't very well. That's more money than I make in a year

94
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,200
200 and sent how did you take that?

95
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,200
I

96
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,520
So long water no seriously. It's water. He's a water millionaire. You want to yeah, yeah

97
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
First you with those people

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Put your name on water

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I invested in vitamin water a company sold a Coca-Cola

100
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:05,680
Did pretty well, but you made was at a hundred million. They're pretty good

101
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,679
That's

102
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,199
That's incredible is it and it's a true now that you're gonna bring out your own range of condoms

103
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,719
I was exploring the idea

104
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:24,439
Then miss that that was the greatest moment of the show

105
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:33,000
You said look I was exploring the concept and idea of developing a new fresher

106
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,320
Safe sex program, you know, like your condoms the wrap it up

107
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,039
Is getting a little old and I think it's uneffective so I have an idea for the condoms

108
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:48,320
You know you can get condoms that I'll give you this you can get condoms that are ribbed for her pleasure

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
Yeah, so why do you turn them inside out please myself?

110
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,559
Now I have to say Dr. Who fans yes, obviously they they're gonna be very torn this week because obviously they love you

111
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,559
So though I want to watch the show because you're on it

112
00:10:02,919 --> 00:10:05,639
But I'm hosting it and they hate me

113
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,199
I just strode the episode of Dr. Who not my fault

114
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:17,639
There was a big cliff hanger it was a big cliff hanger and then just I didn't see it but just as he was back

115
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:20,439
What was he killing someone are going to be killed

116
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:29,399
In the monologue to end the episode and then and then a little animated trailer because I do a show that comes on after Dr

117
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,399
Little animated trailer of me going

118
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,439
Dancing across the screen with up next over the rainbow

119
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,600
They've had I think nearly six thousand complaints. Oh

120
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,360
They don't like me

121
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
I mean it's not

122
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,360
Yeah, you know I think do it again

123
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah, we're doing funny if you next week they do exactly

124
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,879
You began you didn't tell your parents you were doing come no, I did not tell my parents

125
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,159
I was doing comedy for like a few months and they came in they thought I was selling drugs and

126
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,639
They bust the door open one night. We know what you're doing it no one

127
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm telling jokes

128
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,799
Why didn't you just say so

129
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,480
You've seen a lot of your childhood and everybody hates Chris in the sitcom because you relate to your mother

130
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,519
I mean she's out forced to be reckoned with yes, and that the mother's pretty accurate

131
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:45,639
Not really an exaggerate my mother is a ghetto snob

132
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,840
So you can be from the ghetto and still be a snob at the same time so my mother my mother would do things like

133
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:55,199
Send me to get ribs, right?

134
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:59,679
But give me a different bag because she didn't want anybody to see the rib bag coming back

135
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,240
We don't want people to know we read

136
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,240
I

137
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:15,639
Like because you think a lot of parents we you know encourage their their children's kind of high aspirations. Yes, but I you told your mom you

138
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,639
I was a kid

139
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:21,659
Before I want to be a comedian my dream was to be the president of the United States

140
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,440
The only real job I ever wanted okay

141
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:33,200
Only time I wanted an office. I wanted to be the president of the United States. I told my mother. She's like you better not you'll get shot

142
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:42,200
Well, I'm then on I'd never tried to be good in school at all

143
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I can't be president. What's the point?

144
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,480
Emma did Leo bomber's mother did not say that

145
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
She had a different message

146
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,639
Age sucks if you got a face

147
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:04,320
But it is it is because America is really so youth obsessed. I mean how and in the film you show you know kind of that

148
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:11,480
It is hard for a woman of your age to get the jobs. It's beyond difficult the only jobs really left now for women

149
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,960
Unless they get friendly with people to do films

150
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,440
The only jobs that are really commercials. I just thank God

151
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,080
My I made my yearly nut this year on a practical girlie which is for driver China and it's

152
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Well, anyone knows the heartbreak of driver China

153
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
I was perfect for it

154
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
Cavals follow me home

155
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,680
Three Jewish men are trying to rent my uterus instead of going to Miami

156
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,080
But and this

157
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:13,080
God for these commercials there's one called and Zestra is that coming in yet

158
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:23,840
It's like women's Viagra has that happened yet. It's women's Viagra and they have a big discussion with me

159
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,000
Should they make it in pill form? This is honest to God truth

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,120
It was a new favorite pill form or cream because they didn't know which would do better and they find a side of these idiots

161
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:41,519
We'll do it in cream because if it's in pill form in a bar a man can drop it in a woman's drink and she won't know it

162
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,800
But if you're in a bar and a guy goes so where you from?

163
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,840
So I'm I'm not put I love that commercial

164
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,840
Tom how did you end up in the Fresh Prince Biller? They asked me to go on there

165
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,840
But they were enough before that they they were sort of

166
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,840
Talking about me because

167
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:20,840
Carl's was a Tom Jones fan. Yeah. I will used to make fun of that

168
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:36,840
No, no, no, no, no, but I mean you know you can't I was like you know cool and slick and and Carlton was trying to do my moves and all of a sudden

169
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
And then at the end there you are

170
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
Wow both of you unchanged

171
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,840
At the end of the show the last episode of the series and

172
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,840
So Carlton's looking through Will's records and that he has a record of mine. Yeah, so that was it that was a payoff

173
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,480
And it's incredible given you have this phenomenal film career that fresh prince doesn't go away

174
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:16,360
Every country in the world that is the thing that I am most known for no matter how big the movies get it's

175
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Fresh Prince everywhere

176
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I'm a book you or is it listen man long as they scream and will I'm cool

177
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,399
But it's funny because Alfonso Rivera who plays Carlton we were when we first started the show

178
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,360
We were trying to come up with names for the characters and we're going through and we're talking about it

179
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
Now Fonzo pulled me aside. He said man, let me tell you something

180
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,360
He said whatever your character's name is people are gonna call you that for the rest of your life

181
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,720
He said make your character's name will Smith

182
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,039
You know and he was so right and you know when we go out together people are like will will Carlton

183
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
Carlton's better than a fun sir

184
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,359
I
