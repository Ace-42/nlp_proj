1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
The other big Hollywood news is your stand-up tour.

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,400
In almost like a demovie itself, is now inter-induced with sitcom?

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,199
Yeah, I did the stand-up show in America

4
00:00:08,199 --> 00:00:11,040
and some HBO, which is a TV network over there, came up and said,

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,519
you know, what do you think about doing it as a sitcom?

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:16,160
And my stand-up show was about my failure to find a wife

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,559
and general pathetic life as a loser.

8
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:20,800
And they thought, yeah, we want this on TV.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,839
And so that's what we're doing.

10
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:25,039
It's not going to come a huge dilemma, though.

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,240
When they say, too, we want to turn this into a, you know,

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:30,639
a six-part, you know, like masses and masses of series,

13
00:00:30,639 --> 00:00:34,239
that if you find a wife in that time, you ruin your career.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,640
Yeah, he'll keep her in a bunker.

15
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,879
It's sort of where he already does keep her.

16
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,159
LAUGHTER

17
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:42,759
No, it isn't. Yeah, you're right.

18
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:46,200
I mean, it's not a documentary, so I could theoretically be married

19
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,599
and still be acting the role.

20
00:00:47,599 --> 00:00:49,560
It's going to ruin your jam, though, mate.

21
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,159
It would really, it would really be.

22
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,159
Yeah, yeah.

23
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,840
It's fun, OK.

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,439
You're just wishing on me a deep and miserable lonely life.

25
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:57,960
So the laugh keep coming.

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,479
LAUGHTER

27
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,679
Is one of the episodes, is one of the episodes

28
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,959
going to feature that sort of hideous wedding experience you had?

29
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,359
It is. It is. We, uh, yeah, I, I mean,

30
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,640
I thought I'd met this woman of my dreams at this wedding.

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,759
I was at a wedding and you know you get stuck sometimes on a table

32
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,120
with people that you don't know.

33
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,640
And there was this girl opposite and she was dynamite

34
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,640
and we hit it off.

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,560
But I was stuck next to this couple, Oli and Lisa,

36
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,719
and they had this kid, this toddler, in a high-chair,

37
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:23,879
just sat there like that, just, eh.

38
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:26,239
Just bashing this big red stick and stuff.

39
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:27,920
And, um, and the mother wouldn't recommend

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,359
if you just kept going, what's she like?

41
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,359
What's she like?

42
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,319
And she was exhausting and she, she would just dominate the table

43
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:34,519
with these stories.

44
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:36,599
You know those people looked just, they're not really stories.

45
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,679
It was, it was all that, it was all for you.

46
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:44,079
Um, went to the, I went to the, I went up the, um,

47
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,959
the, um, the, no, no, no, no, no, the, um,

48
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,959
supermarket went to the supermarket.

49
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,599
Um, did a big, did a big, um, shop, did a shop.

50
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,959
And then I got back to the checkout

51
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,719
and I'd forgotten the purse and I had to go home for it.

52
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,479
LAUGHTER

53
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:03,280
That was it. Honestly.

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
And I was thinking, if, if that story was making its way

55
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,280
out of my brain towards my mouth,

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,000
another part of my brain would have stepped in and gone,

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,799
eh, where the hell are you going?

58
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:12,719
LAUGHTER

59
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:14,479
This is all wedding. I don't know what this is.

60
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:16,479
This is just some bullshit.

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,280
She was wet right now.

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,400
And then her husband, who's quite a posh bloke, pips up.

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,519
When he goes, um, I recognise you, where do I recognise you from?

64
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:24,879
And I was trying to impress this girl, so I said,

65
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,799
oh, I did this TV show called the office.

66
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:29,759
And he went, oh, the office, yeah, I've seen the office, yeah.

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,879
Not my cup of tea.

68
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:34,079
I'll tell you where you're going wrong with the office.

69
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,280
LAUGHTER

70
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,479
And said, not much story.

71
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:40,240
I'm thinking, yeah, because you know about stories,

72
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
because you're married to bloody Charles Dickinson.

73
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,079
LAUGHTER

74
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,719
And it's important.

75
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:47,719
But that's not the reason I've looked at this girl.

76
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:50,759
I, so this toddler is sat there the whole time, right?

77
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,719
And we're having some soup.

78
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:55,000
And for no reason, this kid just took his shoe off,

79
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,359
just lobbed it in the air.

80
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:58,319
For no reason, it came flying down.

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,639
It landed in my suit.

82
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,159
But I swear, just no one else has touched.

83
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,759
I'm covered in it.

84
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,360
And the mother, Lisa, just went,

85
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,039
oh, wassy like.

86
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,039
LAUGHTER

87
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,039
And I said...

88
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:12,039
LAUGHTER

89
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:15,639
He's like a f***ing...

90
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,039
LAUGHTER

91
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,039
APPLAUSE

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,439
Do you know you've probably seen it?

93
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,879
Harper's Bazaar.

94
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,479
Harper's Bazaar, posh magazine.

95
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,879
It's a new sage in town.

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,879
Yeah, there is a man at the back of it.

97
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,879
What would you like?

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,199
Harper's Bazaar to their, the most powerful women.

99
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,120
It's their 2009 list, the most powerful women

100
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,479
in British theatre.

101
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,120
And look at this picture.

102
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,479
How fabulous.

103
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,479
Do you look there?

104
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,719
That was one of the funniest ten-minute photo shoots I've ever had.

105
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:48,240
That only took ten minutes.

106
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,560
It felt like I literally had ten minutes to run into it.

107
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,919
And we was like...

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,439
Stand like...

109
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,840
I don't know, that's me in the meantime.

110
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,919
The wind was blowing, the lights, the everything.

111
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,879
And we had to like...

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,560
You and Rosman Pike.

113
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,560
Yes.

114
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,560
She's so beautiful, isn't she?

115
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,800
You both are absolutely gorgeous.

116
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Completely manufactured that.

117
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,479
It's all post-production.

118
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,800
But I photo...

119
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,000
You know, Photoshop.

120
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That's what it is.

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,039
I'll get in a stony way back.

122
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,560
LAUGHTER

123
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,879
Go do, sorry about that.

124
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:18,319
Yeah, I shot the one.

125
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,480
Hang on, they're going to mark a pen.

126
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Coloring in the hair.

127
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,280
Yeah, exactly.

128
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
What's the reason?

129
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,959
Because in the research, you know, so they did the research.

130
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,759
The research that you did before I came on, you mean?

131
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,759
Well, that's somebody did.

132
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,759
Yes.

133
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,759
And...

134
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,199
You know, it's got the lists of various things.

135
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,160
And it's got, you know, most powerful women in theatre,

136
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,680
Harper's Bazaar, and then throw it down the list.

137
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,079
And this is like how your life has changed.

138
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,240
Previously on it, Outmagazines list of celebrities

139
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,599
who people would like most like to drink their bath water.

140
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:51,599
Yes.

141
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:52,599
I know.

142
00:04:52,599 --> 00:04:54,199
You were quite high up on that list.

143
00:04:54,199 --> 00:04:55,759
I know. I think I was number one.

144
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,759
Number one?

145
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,279
I was number one. Yes.

146
00:04:58,279 --> 00:04:59,279
Oh, no!

147
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,719
What is it that you put in your bath that makes it so tight?

148
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,000
Just me and all my oils oozing all over the place.

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,519
LAUGHTER

150
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,159
Who the hell was number two?

151
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,760
And may I shaving?

152
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh!

153
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,680
Oh, come on. That's delicious.

154
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,160
I pay a lot of money for that.

155
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:23,040
And when you do theatre, when you do due to pays,

156
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,920
do you get the kind of the science fictiony people coming?

157
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,040
Yes. Yes.

158
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,200
Which is good as well, because they're exposed to a play

159
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
they wouldn't have seen.

160
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
That's true, yeah.

161
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
I mean, don't put that on.

162
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Yeah, all like that.

163
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,960
It's good for them.

164
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,919
But are you a believer in things like the X-Files?

165
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,599
I don't believe the X-Files existed.

166
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:47,759
I think it's a massive conspiracy to keep nerds

167
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,560
at their computers.

168
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,399
No, I don't really...

169
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:54,079
I don't really feel for any of the kind of conspiracy stuff.

170
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:55,599
I don't believe in any of that.

171
00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:57,799
All that moon landings never happened, kind of conspiracy.

172
00:05:57,799 --> 00:06:01,719
You know, 28% of Americans don't think the moon landings happened.

173
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:03,279
In fact, you don't think the moon landings happened.

174
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,199
I'm sorry, if you could do that in 1969, yeah.

175
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,360
Like, we can't do anything now, what do you mean?

176
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,039
It's like, I'm just sort of changing Hoover bags

177
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,199
into the Earth and the night.

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,639
As soon as we can get to the moon, we'll find all these amazing

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:17,639
devices.

180
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,079
Well, no, we'll be able to make a phone call.

181
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,599
I'm doing that.

182
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:26,000
When you, as a child, you assumed that things would be better

183
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
than that.

184
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We live in the future.

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Oh, yeah.

186
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,240
And we always told that at any point, about 30 years from

187
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,039
wherever you're talking, you're going to have jet packs.

188
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:35,039
Yes.

189
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,720
Monorail of flying cars.

190
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Yes.

191
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
Where are they tomorrow's worlds?

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Where are they?

193
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Yes, sir.

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I'm still sat here.

195
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,400
Why isn't Graham having to talk to me out there?

196
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah.

197
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
As I float about the place.

198
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,920
And also, Graham, that's an interesting question.

199
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
How trapped.

200
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,240
Why do we even have legs still?

201
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,759
Why haven't we evolved?

202
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,080
That's why I think maybe things like that,

203
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,920
those conspiracy things might be true.

204
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
I don't know.

205
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
Anyway, look, the reason we're talking about this is you can't hang on.

206
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,120
Because your toast is not good enough, people

207
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,560
think go to the moon.

208
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,280
Toasters are getting worse.

209
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,519
They are.

210
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,920
They used to be great when I was a kid.

211
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,840
Now, too many settings.

212
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,000
If you know, it's like the burnt or raw.

213
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,319
But it got raw.

214
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:16,319
It's so good.

215
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,639
You told me to rip.

216
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:18,639
What's that?

217
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,840
How many of you said it?

218
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,240
One of the great things about toast is it can be eaten raw.

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
We know the harmful facts.

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,959
It's not the same, though.

221
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,120
Anywho, ran over.

222
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,399
What we did is we asked the audience what sort of presence they got.

223
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,079
And some people, in fairness, they didn't get, well,

224
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:39,840
they didn't get great presence.

225
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,199
I've got some of them here.

226
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,519
Now, where's Fabian?

227
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,360
Fabian Devo.

228
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,800
Now, this Fabian, oh, hello, what?

229
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
No, what?

230
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,600
Fabian Devo.

231
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,439
Somebody gave you that.

232
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,600
That's true.

233
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,519
You gave me this?

234
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,360
My ex.

235
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,439
Your ex gave you this.

236
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:56,959
Yeah.

237
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,800
Now, do you have a dog?

238
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
No.

239
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
So, how did he explain it?

240
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,199
Well, he said that at the time in the show,

241
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,040
it was a lovely ball,

242
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,639
and that I think of my cereals in the morning.

243
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:16,879
LAUGHTER

244
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,040
Is this a weird sex game, Fabian?

245
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,840
We supposed to wear a collar at the same time.

246
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,639
So, how did he react?

247
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,840
You opened a dog bow, what did he do?

248
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,480
Well, you go, oh, I love dog playing.

249
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,279
How did he react?

250
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,440
With your positivity, you slap him in face, I'll tell you.

251
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,399
I'll tell you.

252
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,399
What do you see?

253
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,639
What do you see?

254
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,639
What do you see?

255
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:45,240
Do you see a dog?

256
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,240
I am not a dog.

257
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,240
I am a man.

258
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,440
I am a man who tries his hair from one side.

259
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,440
LAUGHTER

260
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,440
It's beautiful.

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
It's beautiful.

262
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
LAUGHTER

263
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,080
Now, this, this is really pissed,

264
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,400
but this is what you're talking about.

265
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Oh, I love it!

266
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,440
LAUGHTER

267
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Mango and papaya!

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
LAUGHTER

269
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Oh, I've often...

270
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,440
Have a time, Joe.

271
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Have a time, Joe.

272
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
You said it the other night.

273
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,920
He said, so often, mango on its own.

274
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,920
So, I select it.

275
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,920
I see mango, I want you and your name.

276
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,919
I love it!

277
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,919
Is that lovely?

278
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:32,919
Who bought this?

279
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,919
Oh, you, their lovely lady.

280
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:36,919
Who gave it to you, first of all?

281
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:37,919
My husband.

282
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,919
You.

283
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,919
You're still together.

284
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,919
Just.

285
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,919
And why was it a particularly bad gift?

286
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,919
I'm allergic to shower, Joe.

287
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,919
LAUGHTER

288
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:49,919
Did he know you were allergic?

289
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:50,919
Yeah, I think you did.

290
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,919
We're being together 21 years.

291
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,919
Do you swell up or something amusing when you show up, Joe?

292
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,919
You're a red and scratch.

293
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,919
That's funny enough. I'll give a shout out.

294
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:01,919
LAUGHTER

295
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:03,919
Game for a laugh?

296
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:04,919
Yeah.

297
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,919
It's lovely.

298
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:07,919
But presumably...

299
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,919
Better presence now, sir.

300
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:11,919
Not really, no.

301
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,919
Travel, Noughts and Crossies last year in Toronto.

302
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,919
Travel, Noughts and Crossies.

303
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,919
This is a game that you can create yourself.

304
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,919
That's a secret.

305
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,919
You're in bed.

306
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,919
You've given someone a pad and a pen.

307
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:29,919
No, you've gone to see a travel north, so cross it.

308
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,919
Oh, it's an electrical.

309
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,919
Oh, save paper, my friend.

310
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:36,919
That is lovely.

311
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,919
I stand correct.

312
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,919
But you like it?

313
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:40,919
No.

314
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:41,919
You've brought it out with you tonight.

315
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:42,919
I love it.

316
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:43,919
Just a bit, yes.

317
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:44,919
Any kind of travel at all?

318
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,919
Are we off, darling?

319
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,919
Let me fetch my travel, Noughts and Crossies.

320
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,919
These lights seem to be taking quite a long time for fans to

321
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,919
play the game of travel.

322
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,919
Oh, no.

323
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,919
You're on Amba.

324
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:00,919
I win!

325
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,919
Very exciting.

326
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,919
Look, I don't know who got this, but Nick...

327
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,919
Look, I found you a cat.

328
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,919
What's wrong with this?

329
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:10,919
You think this was yours?

330
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:11,919
Well, I give that to Nick.

331
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:12,919
Nick, you hold onto that.

332
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,919
So you've got it when the motorbike arrives.

333
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,919
Okay, there you go, Nick.

334
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:17,919
Okay, handy trainers.

335
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,919
They'll come off like some quick.

336
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,919
Okay, so you've got a cat.

337
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:23,919
Who else have I got?

338
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,919
Right now, very quickly, we got an email from someone

339
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:28,919
with this picture.

340
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,919
And I think it's...

341
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,919
Let's have a look at the picture.

342
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:32,919
This is the gift.

343
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,919
This is Kelly.

344
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:35,919
Oh, no.

345
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,919
Now, it's Kelly's here.

346
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:38,919
There's Kelly.

347
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:39,919
Hello.

348
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:40,919
I love Kelly.

349
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:41,919
Looking at her hands, like...

350
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:42,919
I love it.

351
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,919
Like you've never seen that picture before in your life.

352
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:46,919
So your husband...

353
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:50,919
Your husband bought you that outfit.

354
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,919
Thinking you'd like it.

355
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:58,919
I think Kelly's face says it all in the picture, really.

356
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,919
Because it's as if, sir, you went into a shop

357
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,919
and said, I'd like something suitable for my wife

358
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,919
to be buried in.

359
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,919
What is it?

360
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:10,919
Is it supposed to be pajamas?

361
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:11,919
Yes.

362
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:12,919
It's like a baby.

363
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,919
Do you think they're going to be sexy?

364
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,919
Not at all.

365
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,919
No.

366
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,919
At least it does say angel on the tith.

367
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:20,919
So it's like...

368
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:21,919
It's sort of...

369
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:22,919
It's harsh of nice.

370
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,919
We were going on a winter holiday, you know.

371
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,919
It was cold.

372
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,919
I don't think anyone's that cold.

373
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,919
Unless you're at six months old.

374
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,919
So did you have to open up for ten to be pleased?

375
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:37,919
No, I did not pretend to be pleased.

376
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,919
Well, listen, sir, you're obviously not very good at choosing good presents.

377
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,919
So I thought I'd give you some experience of a good present.

378
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,919
Would you help me test a good present, sir?

379
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:50,919
Sure.

380
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,919
What's your name?

381
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:52,919
Neil.

382
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:53,919
Neil.

383
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:54,919
Okay.

384
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:56,919
What it is, somebody sent me this phone, right?

385
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,919
And they make extravagant claims about it.

386
00:12:58,919 --> 00:12:59,919
So nice and on.

387
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:00,919
Let me just check that it's on.

388
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,919
Yes, it is on.

389
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:03,919
So if you take this, take this phone.

390
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Okay.

391
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,919
They claim, right?

392
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:12,919
This phone will operate under extreme thermal conditions.

393
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:14,919
So it's very cold outside to agree,

394
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:15,919
something just being there.

395
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:16,919
Very good.

396
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:18,919
So if you follow the camera there,

397
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,919
I'll ring you as you're walking,

398
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,919
and then we'll see if it's still working when you're outside in the cold.

399
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:24,919
All right.

400
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:28,919
So now, I've got the number for that phone I hope I do.

401
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,919
Six, six, seven, seven.

402
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,919
Okay.

403
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,919
It's calling.

404
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:38,919
It's ringing.

405
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:39,919
Hello, Brian.

406
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:40,919
Oh, hello, Neil.

407
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:41,919
I'm here.

408
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,919
Okay, bring it.

409
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,919
It's not cold yet.

410
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:44,919
Oh, yeah.

411
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,919
So, keep walking to you outside.

412
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,919
I am.

413
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,919
They threw a door out into the cold.

414
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:50,919
There you go.

415
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,919
Now, can you still hear me?

416
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:53,919
I can still hear you.

417
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,919
Okay, stop around there now.

418
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:57,919
Now, Neil, that's very good.

419
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,919
So it's a Sonom XB3 and Juro, apparently.

420
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,919
The world's tough as phone.

421
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,919
It's not just thermal conditions.

422
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:09,919
They say, they make other claims for the phone.

423
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,919
It says here, Neil,

424
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:16,919
that it's a water and liquid proof.

425
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,919
All right, yeah, okay.

426
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:20,919
I guess.

427
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,919
Oh!

428
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:26,919
Oh!

429
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,919
Oh!

430
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,919
Oh, no.

431
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,919
Neil.

432
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,919
Yes, Brian.

433
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,919
Can you hear me now?

434
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,919
I can hear you now.

435
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,919
It's not a free barbell, apparently.

436
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,919
It's also dust and micro particle proof.

437
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,919
All right.

438
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,919
Can you hear me now?

439
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,919
I can't see anything like it.

440
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,919
And that last thing, it is that ready-resistant

441
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,919
to shock an impact, Neil.

442
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:02,919
What?

443
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:06,919
Can you hear me now?

444
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,919
I'm going to have to go.

445
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,919
Well, that's Neil.

446
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:15,919
Wow.

447
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:18,919
Can you enjoy it?
