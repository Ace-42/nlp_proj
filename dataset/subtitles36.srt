1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
What's the difference between a baby and a feminist?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,719
At some point the baby will grow up and stop crying.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,199
How'd it do?

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,199
OK.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,320
What was it?

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,320
So, don't know.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,320
So it was...

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,320
Hey!

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm Sat.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,320
Matt. Nice to meet you.

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,320
Nice to meet you.

15
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,320
First time?

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,320
Oh, yeah.

17
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,320
One, two.

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,320
Don't know what to expect.

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,320
Neither do I.

21
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
This is a baby rock.

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Yeah.

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,320
Seezas, baby rock.

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,320
Seezas, baby rock.

25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Oh!

26
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Oh!

27
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,320
Are you ready to go first?

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,320
Let's have a little geese in here.

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,320
Which animal has the largest chest?

30
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,320
What?

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
A zebra.

32
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,319
That's super close.

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,319
You're going to come out of that, Matty.

35
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:10,319
Let's give me some four-plate, baby.

36
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:11,319
Oh!

37
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,319
Ah!

38
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,319
Oh!

39
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,319
Do me that.

40
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:20,319
Did you hear Mary Poppins stop wearing lipstick while giving head?

41
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,319
Apparently the super-color fragile lipstick makes the dicks atrocious.

43
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,319
I'm fucking impressed.

44
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:31,319
You didn't fuck that hard.

46
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,319
I was in that mirror a lot.

47
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,319
Super fragile dicks.

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,319
Fucking dicks.

49
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Fucking dicks.

50
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,319
Fucking dicks.

51
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:40,319
We're off.

52
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,319
All right. Nice.

53
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,319
You're a lot.

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,319
You're on this one, I love this one.

55
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,319
No.

56
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:46,319
Thank you.

57
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,319
Too little.

58
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,319
A banana.

59
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,319
And a vibrator.

60
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,319
A sitting on a table.

61
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,319
The pedan attends to the vibrator and says,

62
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,319
what are you trembling about?

63
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:02,319
I'm the one about to be eaten.

65
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:06,319
Yeah, not bad.

66
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,319
I'm just getting rid of the fillers and the stuff.

67
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,319
Oh, we didn't do the baths.

68
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:11,319
Where's the chocolate?

69
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:13,319
Oh, next, next one.

70
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,319
I can't really.

71
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,319
I'll lose it.

72
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,319
Are you tightest staring into the blank space in your wall like this one?

73
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,319

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,319
TEMMAR!

77
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,319
Forget paper posters.

78
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:42,319
Display is all metal.

79
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,319

94
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,319
Let's see how durable these gloves...

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,319
...isn't that a bad thing?

96
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
Oh, that's a bad thing.

97
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,319
Oh, that's a bad thing.

98
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,319
F***ing f***ing f***ing.

99
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,319
My mom died when she...

100
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:29,319
I'm sorry.

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,319
Sorry, sorry.

102
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,319
My mom died.

103
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,319
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,319
Is that a path's trick?

105
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,319
Oh, sorry.

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,319
Sorry.

107
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:43,319
Yeah.

108
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:50,319
My mom died when we couldn't remember her blood type.

109
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,319
As she died, she kept telling us to be positive.

110
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,319
It's hard without her.

111
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,319
Oh my god.

112
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:02,319
That's not bad.

113
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,319
That was pretty good.

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,319
My mom died.

115
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,319
That was the...

116
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:09,319
...leaf just for that.

117
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,319
I was front loaded that during.

118
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,319
Hmm.

119
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,319
Oh.

120
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,319
I...

121
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,319
I let out gas while lying on my back.

122
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:22,319
But my balls got in the way.

123
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,319
It was a scrotal eclipse of the fire.

124
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,319
I'm back in the fire.

125
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:30,319
F***ing f***ing f***ing.

126
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,319
F***ing f***ing.

127
00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:35,319
F***ing chaff, bro.

128
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,319
A scrotal eclipse of the fire.

129
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,319
A scrotal eclipse of the fire.

130
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:44,319
F***ing f***ing.

131
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,319
Alright, we'll pick this up.

132
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,319
We'll pick this up.

133
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,319
Alright, let's go.

134
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,319
Ah.

135
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:57,319
Duped off.

136
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,319
Hitless favorite planet.

137
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,319
F***ing f***ing f***ing.

138
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:05,319
Favorite at least favorite.

139
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,319
What's a big gas giant, so...

140
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:10,319
Oh, my god.

141
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,319
There we go.

142
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,319
Second to make the end of it.

143
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:16,319
You fun it now.

144
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:18,319
Well, that's funny.

145
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,319
Shit.

146
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,319
You didn't give it the start, I didn't know you were.

147
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,319
I was waiting, I'm like, just f***ing say it.

148
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,319
Don't leave me up.

149
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,319
I've been aggressively having sex with two twins.

150
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:32,319
And uh-huh.

151
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,319
I've been aggressively having sex with two twins.

152
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,319
I want my friends to ask me, how do you tell them apart?

153
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:41,319
And I'm like, it's very easy.

154
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,319
Uh-uh.

155
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,319
Janice has a piercing on her nose.

156
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
And Henry has two big pairs of hairy balls.

157
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:50,319
Aggressively.

158
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,319
Aggressively.

159
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,319
Uh-huh.

160
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,319
Harry balls are a grudge liquor.

161
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:02,319
It was the two pairs for me.

162
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,319
It's a different.

163
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,319
He has four balls.

164
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:10,319
That is aggressive.

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,319
Oh, okay.

166
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:22,319
Oh, I don't want to do this.

167
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,319
Now, did you hear Princess Diana was on the radio the other day?

168
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,319
Oh, nice.

169
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,319
And the dashboard and the windscreen.

170
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,319
Too soon?

171
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,319
Too soon?

172
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,319
That was good.

173
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,319
Oh.

174
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:48,319
A redneck walked into a protest and immediately got called a racist.

175
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,319
And he was like, I'm not racist.

176
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
My wife has a black eye.

177
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,319
No, okay.

178
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,319
That was good.

179
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,319
That was good.

180
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:08,319
That was a little...

181
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,319
That was the way that one offs up.

182
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,319
Tell me, I'm going to keep this one.

183
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:14,319
Okay.

184
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
Fuck.

185
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
What does a 13-year-old pregnant girl and her unborn baby have in common?

186
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:27,319
Their mom's going to kill him.

187
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:30,319
That's three heavy ones, man.

188
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,319
Sorry.

189
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:38,319
I'll do a clean one.

190
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,319
A pedophile.

191
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:48,319
I'm Australian guy goes to New Zealand and he sees a guy fucking a sheep on the side of the road.

192
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,319
And he goes, in Australia, we shear our sheep.

193
00:07:51,319 --> 00:07:54,319
And then the New Zealand guy goes, fuck off.

194
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,319
And then the baby is like, you're hearing her with anyone.

195
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:02,319
You're hearing her with anyone.

196
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
That's red, I'm just hearing her.

197
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,319
This is not good.

198
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,319
Did I'm whooping out fucking horrible?

199
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,319
I was doing a clean one.

200
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,319
Okay, here you go.

201
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,319
I'll give Rory Pat an Ian arguing over what makes her better pet.

202
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,319
Pat said he loves dogs.

203
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,319
Rory said, nah man, cats are better.

204
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,319
Dogs always be telling the cops where the drugs are.

205
00:08:34,319 --> 00:08:38,319
Ian said, food is food.

206
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:42,319
What's the joke?

207
00:08:42,319 --> 00:08:47,319
Food is food is food.

208
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:51,319
Don't do this to me, Ian!

209
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:54,320
That's just facts.

210
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,320
They're eating the pets.

211
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,320
They're eating the pets.

212
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
That's not a game man.

213
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
You're dick.

214
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Is it edible?

215
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
But you're absolutely.

216
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,320
What's your favorite breed of doggy?

217
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,320
We've seen with Chilly first.

218
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I need to be a little too slow.

219
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I never go.

220
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
Oh god.

221
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I had sex with a disabled girl.

222
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,320
I handy-clapped those cheeks.

223
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Oh my god.

224
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Did you just...

225
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Did you squirt?

226
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Fuck off.

227
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Did you just fuck off to yourself?

228
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,320
That was a good one.

229
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
I ran that one.

230
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,320
He's back baby.

231
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Today, I found out bananas are gay.

232
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
What?

233
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
That was a joke.

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,320
That's it.

235
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
That's it.

236
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Look at the reaction on Pat right now.

237
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
Don't cut the catch cam.

238
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
It's going off there.

239
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
It's going off at home.

240
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll text you.

241
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll text you.

242
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
I'll text you.

243
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
My phone's turned off.

244
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
My uncle's a really bad antriloquist.

245
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
I'm gonna make two fingers in me and tell me not to speak.

246
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,320
True story.

247
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
What's worse than ants in your pants?

248
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Your uncle.

249
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,320
Your uncle is a mess.

250
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,320
It's making my uncle...

251
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,320
No, whatever you keep touching on the back of my neck.

252
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,320
We're trying to work over each.

253
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
My uncle took my weed, so...

254
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,320
My uncle took my weed, so I took his wheelchair.

255
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
If I'm not rolling, no one is.

256
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
I couldn't concentrate.

257
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
You have a big sweat.

258
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
It was like all the lights.

259
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Oh, no.

260
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,320
This is bad.

261
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,320
This is the best episode ever.

262
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
What's the difference between a baby and a feminist?

263
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
At some point, the baby will grow up

264
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,320
and stop crying.

265
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
What did the...

266
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
That was your fault.

267
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,320
That was absolutely the anti-fend.

268
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,320
What did the mentally challenged kid get on his maths test?

269
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
What did you get in your test, Timmy?

270
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
What test?

271
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
I'm not a tackle.

272
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,320
What did the mentally challenged kid get on his maths test?

273
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Drove.

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
That's a fucking thing.

275
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
That's a good one.

276
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
That's a drill.

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
That's a drill.

278
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Yeah, it's a ruck.

279
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Oh, this is not good.

280
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
This is fucking great, dude.

281
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I tried picking up this Asian girl the other night.

282
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
I was descending into math.

283
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I hope this is worth it.

284
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I tried picking up this Asian girl the other night.

285
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Sex, sex, sex.

286
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Free sex tonight.

287
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I was like, wow.

288
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,320
And a friend said, hey, that's actually her number.

289
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
66636 tonight.

290
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
29.

291
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,320
29.

292
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
Okay, okay.

293
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
I'll bring it back and bring it back.

294
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
No, no, no.

295
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
Look me in the fucking eyes with this next joke.

296
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
Call him daddy.

297
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
I'm gonna call him my poem just like my search history.

298
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Disabled.

299
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Oh, no.

300
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Where's Bummin?

301
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
Where's Bummin?

302
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Dude, you're Bummin, man.

303
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I mean, I'll be there shit together for fucking months, man.

304
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Oh, no.

305
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Let me back that up with this one.

306
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,320
I just got my doctor's test results and I'm really upset about it.

307
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Why?

308
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,320
Turns out I'm not gonna be a doctor.

309
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Got you, bitch.

310
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,320
What do you call a Mexican baptism?

311
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Before you say it, shall I?

312
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Yes, what do you call a Mexican baptism?

313
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,320
A baptism.

314
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Bean dip.

315
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Oh, no.

316
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
That one!

317
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Wow.

318
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
This is setting up the truth.

319
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Matt was too drunk to get any of my jokes.

320
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Oh, my God.

321
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
I said my word.

322
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Oh, no.

323
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,320
I said my word.

324
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,320
Oh, no.

325
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,320
I said my word.

326
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
No, no.

327
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
We're all bitch.

328
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Woo!

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Please go!

330
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,320
So when's that hate child guy?

331
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,320
I have to go.

332
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I have to go.

333
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Oh, my God.

334
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,320
We did it!

335
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
We did it!
