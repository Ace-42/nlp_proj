1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,280
Can you believe it's been five years since our first date?

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,679
I know.

3
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:11,640
Do you think I should start watching the Flash TV show?

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,880
LAUGHTER

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:19,519
That's what you're thinking about?

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,120
Well, one of the things.

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,920
Are any of them me?

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,199
Yes.

9
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:29,440
I thought, I can't decide if I should watch the Flash TV show.

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,640
I know. I'll ask Amy.

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:36,800
Anyway.

12
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,240
What are you doing?

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,600
You're right. You did kind of kill the mood.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,120
I didn't kill anything.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,480
You did talking about your stupid TV show.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,920
Excuse me?

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,680
Starting to watch a television show that might run for years

18
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,799
isn't a decision to take lightly.

19
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,400
I'm wrestling with a big commitment issue here.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,560
Really?

21
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,400
That's the commitment issue you're wrestling with.

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,600
Sheldon, do you understand the irony of your fixation

23
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,520
on a man with super speed?

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,920
Well, after five years, all I can get out of you

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,240
is a distracted make-out session on a couch.

26
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,640
Irony's not really my strong suit.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,480
But I have been getting better with sarcasm

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,040
if you want to give that a try.

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,879
Oh, sure. I'd love to.

30
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:26,960
Whenever you're ready.

31
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,479
She passed me the man in Sheffitts.

32
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,799
I took one look at this poem and almost

33
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,119
plots on the cougill.

34
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:35,639
I know.

35
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,479
Is this what I saw naked and talk about in you?

36
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,559
So my mother's OK with this?

37
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:45,119
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stewart?

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,359
Because they have a weird and appropriate relationship.

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:51,000
Weirder than what you and I did in my dad's corolla?

40
00:01:54,639 --> 00:01:56,159
This is so messed up.

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,119
I know. I'm having the best time.

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:01,840
Why would you even come to this?

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,599
Didn't you know I'd be here?

44
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:05,479
It was a long time ago, Howard.

45
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:07,959
And your only second cousin, Zooka Ears.

46
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,439
So you knew when you brought her anyway?

47
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,120
Oh, so she's good enough for Howard, but not for me?

48
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,639
Yeah.

49
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,960
Yeah, go have weird relationships with your own mother

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,479
and cousin.

51
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:17,359
This is his turf.

52
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,439
Yeah.

53
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,519
OK, I got to ask.

54
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
What makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,400
in ours is it?

56
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,400
For starters, we enjoy spending time together.

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,160
So do we.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,360
And I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours

59
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,200
doing totally different things.

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,000
It's called parallel play.

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,719
You got toddlers do that.

62
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,800
Not as well as we do.

63
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,200
You believe this guy has to be the best in everything?

64
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:55,439
So what? Why do you even care?

65
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,919
Oh, listen to them.

66
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,000
Not even married in the honeymoon's over.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,599
Whatever.

68
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,199
You can't even go on a date without checking

69
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,239
your relationship agreement.

70
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:08,719
If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract,

71
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,959
I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies

72
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,839
that entered a relationship agreement called the US

73
00:03:14,839 --> 00:03:16,839
Constitution.

74
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,879
And it may not be cool to say so,

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,199
but I think that love affair is still pretty hopped today.

76
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,519
It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now

77
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:28,439
because there's about to be a fire.

78
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,879
Oh, it's beautiful.

79
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,759
The girls really did a nice job.

80
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,239
Oh, I know I wasn't into this before,

81
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,319
but I'm so glad I get to take you to your first prom.

82
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:45,079
What makes you think I didn't go to my prom?

83
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:46,039
Oh, my went.

84
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:47,199
Who would you go with?

85
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,919
I took a little idea.

86
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,039
I like to call loneliness.

87
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,560
No, it's all right.

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,280
We ended up having a threesome with her friend Humiliation.

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,280
LAUGHTER

90
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,319
Well, if I would have been there and saw you alone,

91
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:02,560
I would have asked you to dance.

92
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,560
Oh, you wouldn't dance.

93
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,759
Well, they don't know that.

94
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,280
It was before my growth spurt.

95
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,479
What that already happened?

96
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,479
Ah.

97
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,439
Very funny.

98
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,959
Well, you wouldn't have asked me either.

99
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,600
I would have asked you in my head on the way home.

100
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,120
While I was having a good cry.

101
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,080
I've invented a science joke.

102
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,080
Could you like to hear it?

103
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,439
Sure.

104
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:32,480
How many Edison's does it take to screw in a light bulb?

105
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,439
How many?

106
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,280
Who cares?

107
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,000
He stole the idea and doesn't deserve a zone joke.

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,520
Is that really true?

109
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,480
Of course.

110
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,000
That's how you know it's a good joke.

111
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
It not only entertains, it informs.

112
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

113
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,040
Barry, how many Edison's does it take to screw in a light bulb?

114
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Did you know Edison didn't actually invent the white bulb?

115
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,840
LAUGHTER

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
What do you want, Barry?

117
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,040
Just wanted to walk this office with all.

118
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,319
Thank you for Amy.

119
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,639
What's this for?

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,560
Your idea willy helped me out.

121
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,160
My white conquantization paper is online already.

122
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,600
The response has been amazing.

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
Well, that's fascinating.

124
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,920
I can't wait to read it.

125
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,439
You don't know me as well.

126
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,959
A please email it to sheldonatbezenga.biz.

127
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,120
Why dot biz?

128
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,639
Because I just gave you the business.

129
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,360
And also bezenga.com was taken.

130
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,720
This is an easy one.

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
You love this guy.

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,040
Me.

133
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Come on, he's an underappreciated genius.

134
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,399
Still think it's me.

135
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,600
It's not you.

136
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,319
Now think, there's a car named after him.

137
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:43,600
Of course there he is.

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,120
The mini-cooper, because it's me.

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
LAUGHTER

140
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,120
How about this?

141
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,760
He's a poor man's sheldon cooper.

142
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Oh, Tesla.

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Hi.

144
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
How'd it go?

145
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Not fun.

146
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,920
The doctor shoved a camera up into my sinuses.

147
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,760
Yeah, I watched.

148
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,280
He was like the scary boat tunnel in Willy Wonka.

149
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,560
LAUGHTER

150
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,920
Did they figure out what's wrong?

151
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,520
Yeah, it's a deviated septum.

152
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,879
The surgery to crack to the simple.

153
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,200
He's going to do it in that sweet.

154
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Why would you have surgery?

155
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,680
Because I can't breathe.

156
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,959
Well, I snore. I get sinus infections.

157
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,639
Now back off. He's on mine.

158
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:21,839
But you don't have a life threatening condition.

159
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,759
Why would you take the risk of surgery?

160
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,519
Sheldon, it's a routine procedure.

161
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,560
I've heard you complain about his snoring.

162
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
What?

163
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,879
Yeah, that's for the first five or six years,

164
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,120
but I've gotten used to it.

165
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,680
It helps me sleep.

166
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,839
He's like my mucus powered wide noise machine.

167
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,839
LAUGHTER

168
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,160
Sheldon, I'm going to get the surgery.

169
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,839
It's no big deal on the story.

170
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:41,639
Very well.

171
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,639
Now I'm done talking about it.

172
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,479
Thank you.

173
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:44,919
I believe it was your turn in the game.

174
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:45,919
Oh, OK.

175
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:48,919
Let's see.

176
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,519
Oh, this person is most famous

177
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,039
for never having gotten his nose mutilated

178
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,599
with elective surgery,

179
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,439
and never living the rest of his life in the shadows

180
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,800
as the hideous, disfigured freak.

181
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
LAUGHTER

182
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,599
I think you could give a better clue.

183
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,079
I don't.

184
00:07:05,079 --> 00:07:07,680
I'm not even sure if that's a person or a typo.

185
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,479
Do you guys ever fight over money?

186
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,319
Sure, sometimes.

187
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:12,519
I mean, it could be a little awkward

188
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,680
since I make so much more money than how he...

189
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,680
LAUGHTER

190
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,879
You didn't have to say so much more.

191
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,879
Well, I didn't have to, but for the sake of accuracy,

192
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:21,879
I felt that I should.

193
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,879
LAUGHTER

194
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,360
I brought a lot of significant assets

195
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,560
into the relationship, too.

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,240
Like what?

197
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,959
Your incomplete set of star-check collector plates?

198
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,800
LAUGHTER

199
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,360
For your information, I just bought the last one

200
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
I needed on eBay.

201
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
LAUGHTER

202
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Without asking?

203
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
LAUGHTER

204
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
There were only three minutes left in the auction,

205
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:43,960
and it was a mint-conditioned Scotty from a smoke-free home.

206
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
LAUGHTER

207
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,800
How much, Ali?

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,960
Not a lot.

209
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
How much?

210
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,439
It's not talk about this in front of our friends.

211
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:56,920
Was it more or less than falconry schools?

212
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,680
LAUGHTER

213
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,280
For the tenth time that was, A, Groupon.

214
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,320
Would you enjoy my lecture?

215
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,280
No, and neither did our waiter.

216
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,280
LAUGHTER

217
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:10,719
If you're going to serve Cornish Gamehen,

218
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:13,319
you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall

219
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,279
or be prepared to learn it.

220
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:16,279
LAUGHTER

221
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,279
It's hard to argue with that, and I know,

222
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:21,919
because I saw a sad man with a pepper mill desperately try and fail.

223
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,919
LAUGHTER

224
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:28,679
Hey, how was dinner?

225
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,879
Good. I had Cornish Gamehen.

226
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,720
Oh, that poor waiter.

227
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,720
LAUGHTER

228
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,519
Sheldon, how about tomorrow night we see a movie?

229
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,480
You guys are going out two nights in a row?

230
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,679
Yeah, well, I missed a number of date nights

231
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,079
while I was on my train trip,

232
00:08:43,079 --> 00:08:45,439
and I'm contractually obligated to make them up

233
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:48,399
under the terms of the relationship agreement.

234
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,199
That's so hot.

235
00:08:50,199 --> 00:08:51,360
LAUGHTER

236
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,559
It's better than hot, it's binding.

237
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,559
LAUGHTER

238
00:08:55,559 --> 00:09:00,279
If you're free tomorrow night, I'd love to have you join us on a double date.

239
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,799
Aw.

240
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:04,840
You are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates.

241
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,840
LAUGHTER

242
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Oh.

243
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,040
Well, then come her down, I don't care.

244
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,000
They're not dating. They're just two friends who went out to dinner.

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,960
And then went back to the room they share

246
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,000
where they probably fell asleep in the matching pajamas.

247
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,680
She got them because they both just love penguins.

248
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
LAUGHTER

249
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,639
Lots of people wear matching pajamas who aren't dating.

250
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:29,680
Like who? Like you and your dog.

251
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,879
LAUGHTER

252
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:33,879
They don't rule out the dating.

253
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,400
LAUGHTER

254
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,720
Fine. It bothers me.

255
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,799
Happy?

256
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,799
You think you've got problems?

257
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,799
The Gibbon is the only member of the ape family

258
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,600
not classified as a great ape.

259
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
LAUGHTER

260
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,959
How is this helpful?

261
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,959
All the non-human apes are classified as great apes except one.

262
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:56,959
That means tax on them has created the entire category

263
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,919
of a lesser ape just to single out the poor Gibbon

264
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,919
as the weird kid on the playground.

265
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:02,919
LAUGHTER

266
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,959
Now, there's a hairy little fella with a genuine beef.

267
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:06,959
LAUGHTER

268
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,479
But the Gibbon doesn't know what it's categorized as.

269
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:11,719
It doesn't even know it's called a Gibbon.

270
00:10:11,719 --> 00:10:13,479
True.

271
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:16,079
Sorry, kids, you got it worse than a Gibbon.

272
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,079
But I made a video.

273
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
LAUGHTER

274
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,599
I'm Dr. Shelton Cooper.

275
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:26,279
And I'd like to tell you why I should be chosen to...

276
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,799
Go to Mars!

277
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:30,799
LAUGHTER

278
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,319
I'm exceedingly smart.

279
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,399
I graduated college at 14.

280
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
While my brother was getting an STD, I was getting a PhD.

281
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
LAUGHTER

282
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,959
Penicillin can't take this away.

283
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,559
LAUGHTER

284
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,959
Being in close quarters, cleanliness is important.

285
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:49,199
LAUGHTER

286
00:10:49,199 --> 00:10:51,519
My hygiene is impeccable.

287
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,519
In fact, animals don't trust me because I smell like nothing.

288
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,519
Yet.

289
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,759
Sigh.

290
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,240
Literally nothing.

291
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,240
LAUGHTER

292
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,480
During the seven-month space flight, I can keep up morale

293
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,159
with my wacky sense of humor.

294
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,159
LAUGHTER

295
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
Hey, Leonard.

296
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,759
Is there any peanut brittle left in that can?

297
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,720
You mean this weirdly suspicious one?

298
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,759
Yes.

299
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:19,960
Open it and check.

300
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,960
LAUGHTER

301
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,000
I don't get it.

302
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,519
There's actually peanut brittle left.

303
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:30,519
LAUGHTER

304
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,360
Please go to Mars.

305
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,799
But on a more serious note, the most important reason I want to go to Mars

306
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:51,240
is that I believe as a scientist, it's my duty to push the boundaries of human knowledge forward.

307
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,360
Now, I know that life on Mars will be difficult,

308
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,240
but life here on Earth is no picnic.

309
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,080
Also, picnics are no picnic.

310
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,080
LAUGHTER

311
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,560
Where should we go for lunch? Oh, I know, the ground.

312
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
LAUGHTER

313
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,279
In conclusion, thank you for considering me for this journey of a lifetime.

314
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,759
Tomorrow!

315
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:14,759
Tomorrow!

316
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:15,960
LAUGHTER

317
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,560
That's ridiculous.

318
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
You know, I'm going to go talk to the meter, D.

319
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
What are you going to say?

320
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,800
I don't know. I'm going to flirt with him.

321
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:25,719
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that.

322
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:28,120
I'm still sleeping with you tonight.

323
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,639
So you even get a title by the window.

324
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:31,639
LAUGHTER

325
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:36,439
Hi there. What's your name?

326
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:37,240
Glenn.

327
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,599
Oh, boy, it is crazy in here tonight, huh, Glenn?

328
00:12:40,599 --> 00:12:42,839
Well, you know, Valentine's Day?

329
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,120
Yes. Uh, but your girlfriend is super bummed you had to work tonight.

330
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,439
Anyway, look, we have been waiting a while, and I just...

331
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,800
With all due respect, man, there's nothing I can do.

332
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
You don't have to call me man.

333
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,640
OK. I mean, we're basically the same age.

334
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
OK.

335
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
LAUGHTER

336
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,480
How old are you?

337
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,840
I'm 21. How old are you?

338
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,400
Just shut up, Glenn.

339
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,280
Come on, let's get out of here.

340
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:14,840
What? Why?

341
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,280
Because I'm young, let's go.

342
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,920
Seems we're at a, uh, stalemate.

343
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,319
Not technically.

344
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:25,479
In chess, a stalemate refers to a situation in which there are no remaining moves.

345
00:13:25,479 --> 00:13:27,479
Uh, you have plenty of moves available.

346
00:13:27,479 --> 00:13:29,159
You could beat us up and steal the money.

347
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:31,719
You could kill us.

348
00:13:33,559 --> 00:13:36,120
Really, you're only limited by your imagination.

349
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:42,839
Well, all these years have been using stalemate when I really mean impasse.

350
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,919
I feel foolish.

351
00:13:45,719 --> 00:13:47,719
LAUGHTER

352
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,479
I don't think it matters if this is a stalemate or an impasse or a Mexican standoff.

353
00:13:53,479 --> 00:13:54,439
What are we going to do here?

354
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:56,439
Oh, how can it be a Mexican standoff?

355
00:13:56,439 --> 00:13:58,039
Everybody knows you need three sites for that.

356
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,279
Not necessarily.

357
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:06,759
You know, many argue that essence of a Mexican standoff is that no one can walk away from the conflict without incurring harm.

358
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,599
Hmm, I don't follow.

359
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,480
Let me give you an example.

360
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,360
Earlier today, I decoded the headers on your email, and I know that your name is Kenneth Fitzgerald.

361
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,159
From that, I figured out where you live and where you work.

362
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,000
Now, to make this a Mexican standoff, I would say something like, uh,

363
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,960
well, you give us the helium or I'll turn you into the authorities.

364
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,879
Is that a threat?

365
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,399
Yeah, exactly. See, you're getting it.

366
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:33,800
What is this?

367
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,960
I don't know. Maybe it says something on the back?

368
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,320
Continue it on milk.

369
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,920
You're tricking me to making my own breakfast.

370
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,519
It didn't work for my mom and it won't work for you.

371
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,320
Are we...

372
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,000
Are...

373
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,120
Seaspoons for more?

374
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,080
What could it be?

375
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,519
We are Groot.

376
00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:58,360
We are the champions.

377
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,720
We are family.

378
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,080
I got all my sisters with me.

379
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:06,840
Are you serious?

380
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:08,600
Yeah.

381
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you sure?

382
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,480
Are you positive?

383
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
That's a joke, because the pregnancy test says I'm...

384
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
It's incredible.

385
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
We're gonna be parents?

386
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,480
We're gonna get to board planes first.

387
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,480
We're finally gonna get to see what's in that family bathroom at the mall.

388
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
No, it's crazy.

389
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
It is crazy.

390
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Oh.

391
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Oh.

392
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,480
I mean, how do you prepare for something like this?

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I'm not even sure I've held a baby before.

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,480
It's okay. You figure it out.

395
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
How's this all gonna work?

396
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
Do we get a nanny?

397
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Can we afford a nanny?

398
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,480
If we can, we can't get a pretty one because we'll wreck our marriage.

399
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,480
We can't get an ugly one because it'll scare the kid.

400
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Are we gonna get schooled this straight with your Catholic?

401
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
I'm Jewish. What religion do we raise it?

402
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
And if it's a boy, do we get him circumcised?

403
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,480
People say it's barbaric, but if we don't, it looks like a pig in a blanket.

404
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Oh, damn, it's gonna be okay.

405
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
How's it gonna be okay?

406
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,480
Look at me. I'm a mess.

407
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,480
That means this baby's gonna be half a mess.

408
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,480
And that's even before we screw it up with our cut rate moderately attractive nanny.

409
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
Oh, there's a woman.

410
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,480
I'll make her my girlfriend.

411
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,480
Oh, walking up to a strange woman in a bar, usually doesn't look.

412
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
You're forgetting something.

413
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Ladies love jocks.

414
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
I'm at least six of the beauty of her three.

415
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Excuse me. I'm recovering from a recent breakup.

416
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,480
And I'm told asking out another woman might make me feel better.

417
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,480
And as Ash Ketchum said to Pikachu, I choose you.

418
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
What?

419
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
It's a Pokemon reference.

420
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,480
I don't know what that means.

421
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
Well, we gave it a shot.

422
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
How about you?

423
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,480
I'm married. And I'm a grandmother.

424
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
Ah, what might have been?

425
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:29,480
And you give my regards to Barnum and Bailey.

426
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,480
You're eating? That's a good sign.

427
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,480
You're gonna have to wait one hour until you can go swimming again.

428
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
He's pretty cute.

429
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
He is.

430
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Do we name him?

431
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
His Valentine's Day.

432
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
How about Valentino?

433
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Nice.

434
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Classic rabbit name.

435
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Peter Rabbit, Roger Rabbit, Valentino Wallowitz Rabbit.

436
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Oh, look at all that chest hair and over bite, of course, you're a Wallowitz.

437
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Son of a bitch, he bit me.

438
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
Are you okay?

439
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,480
No, I'm not okay. Wild rabbits can have rabies.

440
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Why'd you put your finger in your mouth?

441
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Poor judgment, obviously.

442
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,480
He's so little, I'm sure it's fine.

443
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,480
How can it be fine? I just got attacked by a clearly antisemitic wild animal.

444
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,480
It says rabies and rabbits is highly unlikely.

445
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Terrific.

446
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
It's not terrific.

447
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Lots of highly unlikely things happen.

448
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
You saw what's under this robe and you still married me?

449
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
If you're really worried, we'll take them to the vet and have them tested.

450
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Thank you.

451
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Okay, there is a test.

452
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,480
All they have to do is cut off his head and check his brain.

453
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
Oh, cut off his head.

454
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,480
That's where his little noses.

455
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,480
He's not showing any symptoms.

456
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,480
I guess I'll just go to the emergency room to be safe.

457
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Howie, this is just your hypocondria.

458
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,480
When I sat on the mute button and thought I'd gone deaf, that was my hypocondria.

459
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
There was a song I couldn't get out of my head.

460
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Eventually I realized the song was about you.

461
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,480
And like that earworm, I can't get you out of my heart.

462
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,480
So what I'm trying to say is, you're my heartworm.

463
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:30,480
The metaphorical kind, not the poodle killing kind.

464
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
What?

465
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,480
If I may, I believe what he's saying in a charming and delightful way is that he loves you and wants you back.

466
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Dave Gibbs, huge fun if you work. Don't mind me.

467
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were on a date.

468
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,480
No, it's okay. Keep going.

469
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Amy, if you want to be my girlfriend again, I really want to be your boyfriend.

470
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,480
I really want that too.

471
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:06,480
Good. Because I love you.

472
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I love you too.

473
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,480
Kiss her, you brilliant fool.

474
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Dear crazy future sheldon.

475
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
This is a thermostat.

476
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,480
It controls the temperature of the apartment.

477
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,480
The ideal setting is 72 degrees.

478
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,480
If you find this too cold, then put on a jacket.

479
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,480
A straight jacket, because 72 is the best and you're crazy.

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,480
Now, this is your spot.

481
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
You're very protective of it.

482
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,480
When anyone else tries to sit here, you berate them relentlessly.

483
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,480
And it sounds mean, but somehow you make it adorable.

484
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,480
People are also delighted by your love of pranks.

485
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,480
For example, Leonard has no idea what I did to his coffee.

486
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,480
It wasn't replaced with Folters, Crystals.

487
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
I'll tell you that much.

488
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Hey, can we please get back to work?

489
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
This is Leonard.

490
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,480
He's your best friend in the world.

491
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Just stop. This is ridiculous.

492
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Sometimes he gets cranky.

493
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
But you can trust him with your life.

494
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:29,480
And he does more things for you than I can even begin to list.

495
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
Thank you.

496
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Don't know he's drinking it.

497
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
Come on, Leonard's doing bachelor's stuff.

498
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Are you sure we can't take you to a strip club?

499
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,480
If I want to see a naked, dancing man,

500
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,480
I just flush the toilet while Leonard's in the shower.

501
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
Hi.

502
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
Hey.

503
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,480
I know we're not making a fuss, but in the spirit of bachelor at parties,

504
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,480
I made cookies in the shape of male genitals.

505
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,480
Really didn't have to...

506
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Whoa!

507
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
That is anatomic.

508
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Thank you. The veins are gummy worms.

509
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Oh, look.

510
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,480
She was shunned, Gentile.

511
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,480
I had extra dough.

512
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Oh, that's Leonard. He said they're about to cross the border.

513
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
I hope the boys don't get too crazy in Mexico.

514
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
Oh, right. You'll lock up your daughters or Sheldon might lecture them

515
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,480
about the North American free trade agreement.

516
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Boy, that was a long night for me.

517
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,480
What do you think?

518
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I think it's very cute.

519
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
Cute? It's not cute.

520
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,480
Cute as children dressed as vegetables.

521
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Okay, fine. It's not cute.

522
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,480
Just be honest. You don't like it.

523
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I didn't say that. I just like music you can dance to.

524
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
You can dance to this.

525
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
A-a-a-a.

526
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
Thor and Dr. Jones.

527
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
Thor and Dr. Jones.

528
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
One plays with Lightning, the other plays with Bob.

529
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,480
I'm telling you dude, the song is no groove. You can't dance to it.

530
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,480
Who cares?

531
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,480
I thought the whole point of Footprints on the Moon was to write songs that make people think.

532
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
You can do both!

533
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,519
Like Michael Jackson's Billie Jean,

534
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:25,279
while you're dancing, you're thinking,

535
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,519
like, don't it, whose baby is it?

536
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:29,519
That's a funny spot collectibles.

537
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:30,519
I have many.

538
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,519
My most treasured is an autographed napkin,

539
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,920
given to me by my very thoughtful friend Penny.

540
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,519
That's her over there.

541
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,519
Hi.

542
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:43,519
Look at that.

543
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,519
A minute movie? My shirt's stayed on.

544
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:49,519
Can we see the napkin?

545
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,559
Of course. Excuse me.

546
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:53,559
This will just take a moment.

547
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,559
When did we get a wall safe?

548
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,559
When there was no more room in the floor safe.

549
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:13,559
When did we get a floor safe?

550
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,559
When we got the security camera.

551
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,559
There's a security camera?

552
00:24:20,519 --> 00:24:23,519
Aw, man. Protecting your homes since 2012.

553
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:27,519
Oh, my God. We've done things on that couch.

554
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,519
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

555
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,519
Have you thought about advertising directly to females?

556
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,519
Mm, okay.

557
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,519
Well, all right.

558
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:40,519
What if I put up a sign in the window that said,

559
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,519
women come in.

560
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:44,519
Don't be afraid.

561
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,519
Hey, have you read the online reviews for this place?

562
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,519
Mm, Internet's so negative I try to avoid it.

563
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,519
All right. Well, Heather H says,

564
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,519
the owner stared at me the whole time and didn't blink once.

565
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,519
Kelly M says,

566
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,519
the creepy guy who runs it asked me out

567
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,519
and called himself stupid before I could say no.

568
00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:21,519
Just okay.

569
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,519
Says,

570
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,519
I told the weird owner that I liked his shirt.

571
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:27,519
He took it off and gave it to me.

572
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:32,519
See? Negative.

573
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,519
You actually think it's 2003?

574
00:25:34,519 --> 00:25:38,519
No, just because I'm living my life like it was 12 years ago

575
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:39,519
doesn't mean I'm delusional.

576
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:41,519
And since it is 2003,

577
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:43,519
I don't know who you are.

578
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:45,519
So please exit the premises before I call the police

579
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,519
on my stylish new flip phone.

580
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,519
Hello, 2003.

581
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,519
Hey, we brought you to...

582
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,519
Where is everything?

583
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,519
In my present, it's in the future.

584
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,519
In your present, it's been crammed in the bedroom

585
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,519
by an enterprising young man I met in the Home Depot parking lot.

586
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:09,519
I know what you're doing.

587
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:11,519
You're trying to get attention so we'll feel bad for you,

588
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:13,519
but it's not happening.

589
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,519
No, what I'm dealing with is the same.

590
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,519
No, what I'm doing is trying to figure out how to live my life

591
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:21,519
now that everyone is leaving me.

592
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:23,519
Knock it off or across the hall.

593
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,519
As the kids are saying today, talk to the ham.

594
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,519
They're not saying that.

595
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:32,519
They are in 2003.

596
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,519
No, no, they're really not.

597
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,519
He started...

598
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,519
Hey.

599
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,519
Surrey, day startle you?

600
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,519
Yes, but at this point, pretty much any customer does.

601
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,519
What can I do for you?

602
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:48,519
I need a little help.

603
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:51,519
I accidentally destroyed one of Howard's comics boxes morning

604
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:53,519
and I was hoping I could replace it.

605
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:54,519
Wow, what happened?

606
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,519
Batman got his ass kicked by my curling iron.

607
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,519
Don't let the riddler know that.

608
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,519
It's a comic book joke.

609
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,519
Or maybe it's not.

610
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:10,519
Dad, this one?

611
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:12,519
Well, it's pretty rare.

612
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:14,519
Can you give me a few days to track it down?

613
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:17,519
I was kind of hoping to get it before how he comes home from work.

614
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,519
What's the hurry?

615
00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,519
Well, he's always saying I should be more careful with my curling iron

616
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,519
and it seems like a dangerous precedent to let him think he can be right.

617
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,519
Well, do what I can, but I can't make any promises.

618
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,519
You know, I do work at a pharmaceutical company.

619
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,519
If you can make this happen today, I can hook you up with anxiety medication

620
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,519
and I depress you.

621
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,519
Really?

622
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,519
Do you have any of these?

623
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,519
I feel like everything is falling apart.

624
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,519
Come on, it's okay.

625
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,519
No, it's not okay. Look at me.

626
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,519
It took a temp job as a waitress forever ago.

627
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,519
I'm still doing it.

628
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,519
I can't quit because guess what?

629
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:02,519
I can't do anything else and I finally get my big break and it goes away.

630
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:04,519
Such a mess.

631
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,519
No, you're not.

632
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,519
Really?

633
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,519
Because this morning at Starbucks, a pair of old underwear fell out of my pant leg.

634
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,519
And it wasn't the only one in there.

635
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,519
Okay, listen to me.

636
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:20,519
This is just a minor setback.

637
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:21,519
No, it's not.

638
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,519
Okay, I've been out here for like 10 years.

639
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:25,519
I have nothing to show for it.

640
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,519
Well, you have me.

641
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:29,519
Right.

642
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:32,519
I do have you.

643
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,519
Let's get married.

644
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,519
What?

645
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,519
Let her have a setter.

646
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,519
Will you marry me?

647
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,519
Oh.

648
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,519
Did you seriously just say, oh.

649
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:59,519
You know, I love you.

650
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,519
But put your your drunken sad and feeling lost.

651
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:05,519
Okay, so do you you don't want to marry me?

652
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,519
That is not what I said.

653
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:08,519
No, forget it.

654
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:10,519
I take it back, offers off the table.

655
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,519
Who's in the mood to laugh?

656
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,519
I got an email from Professor Proton.

657
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,519
Goody, what's it say?

658
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,519
He's working on a paper about nano vacuum tubes and wants to know if I take a look at it.

659
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,519
A strange thing would come to you for that and not me.

660
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:31,519
Oh, I got two emails from him.

661
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,519
Do you have Leonard's email address?

662
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,519
And never mind I found it.

663
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,519
I can't believe he picked you over me.

664
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,519
I don't want to read a paper by some old husband who hasn't done any real science and decades.

665
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:54,519
Yeah, it's nothing to cry about.

666
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:57,519
Sheldon Cooper does not cry.

667
00:29:57,519 --> 00:29:58,519
It's true.

668
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:00,519
You'd rust.

669
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:08,519
When Obi-Wan came to Luke on this very spot, he gave him all sorts of helpful advice.

670
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,519
So, um, what do you got for me?

671
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,519
Um, always.

672
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,519
Get, get a prenup.

673
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:27,519
That's it.

674
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,519
I thought there'd be more of a reason why you're here.

675
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,519
Oh.

676
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,519
Why do you think I'm here?

677
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:38,519
I suppose it has something to do with your recent passing.

678
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,519
It's just the first time you've lost, you know, someone close to you.

679
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,519
Oh, no.

680
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,519
No.

681
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,519
I've already had to say goodbye to 11 doctors.

682
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:56,519
Yeah, I've, I've lived a few of my doctors too.

683
00:30:56,519 --> 00:30:59,519
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

684
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,519
Hello.

685
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,519
You okay?

686
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:14,519
I'm on vacation.

687
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,519
What do you think?

688
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:21,519
Why are you sitting in the stairwell?

689
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,519
Leonard told me to stay.

690
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:28,519
Oh, well, good boy.

691
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,519
Where are you going?

692
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:31,519
A ton of errands to run.

693
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,519
You need to make copies of my headshot, send them off to agents, and sign up for a new acting class.

694
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,519
Have fun.

695
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,519
Okay.

696
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,519
No.

697
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,519
You want to come with me?

698
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:47,519
Really?

699
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,519
Come on, boy, come on, let's go.

700
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,519
Get the gun.

701
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,519
Come on.

702
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,519
So, what did you think of your first funeral?

703
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,519
Oh, I don't want to be a jerk, but it was kind of a bummer.

704
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:05,519
Yeah, well, when I die, you can rent a bounce house.

705
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,519
Think about dying?

706
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,519
Well, I think more about, if I don't have any regrets.

707
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,519
What would you regret?

708
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:13,519
You know, home.

709
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,519
I didn't travel more.

710
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:16,519
Take more risks.

711
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,519
Learn another language.

712
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,519
You know, cling on.

713
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:22,519
That's true.

714
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:29,519
No, I meant that as a regret.

715
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,519
Just thought of one more.

716
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:32,519
What's up?

717
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:36,519
I regret not saying yes when you asked me to marry you.

718
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,519
Well, it just wasn't the right time.

719
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,519
Yeah.

720
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
And this is also not the right time.

721
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,519
Do not propose.

722
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,519
What?

723
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,519
I know that face, that's your proposed face.

724
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,519
I was not going to propose.

725
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:52,519
It's already two to one.

726
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:53,519
What's two to one?

727
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,519
I proposed twice, you proposed once, two to one.

728
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,519
Oh, my, it's not a contest.

729
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:58,519
Don't know what you're upset about.

730
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:00,519
I'm the one who's losing.

731
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,519
Fine, would you feel better if I proposed so you could turn me down again?

732
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,519
Yeah, I think I would.

733
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,519
Okay, Leonard, will you marry me?

734
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,519
Hmm.

735
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,519
No, don't you dare.

736
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,519
You reject me right now and tie things up.

737
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
It's just such a big decision.

738
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,519
I don't want to have any regrets.

739
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:29,519
And hold three, two, one.

740
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,519
Very good.

741
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,519
Now let's try warrior two.

742
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,519
And hold.

743
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,519
I've read that they're great yogis who have such mastery over their bodies.

744
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,519
They can draw water in through their genitals.

745
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,519
No, well, I don't think we're going to get to do that today.

746
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,519
Too bad.

747
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:06,519
Seems like a good way to drink a milkshake without getting brain freeze.

748
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:10,519
Oh, hey.

749
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,519
Now we go to reverse warrior.

750
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:20,519
How did she get you to do yoga?

751
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:25,519
Well, to be honest, I thought she said Yoda.

752
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,519
Wait, it's not all pants. There's one shirt.

753
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:31,519
Oh, hey, that's my shirt.

754
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,519
This one is too.

755
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,519
No, that's not mine. That's a big spot on it.

756
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:36,519
Oh, wait, so does this one?

757
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:39,519
Maybe the spot's the clue.

758
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,519
Sheldon spot. The poison is black.

759
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:49,519
Oh, that's clever.

760
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:54,519
Be there in a minute. I just had to preso, please.

761
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:11,519
Where the hell is the coin?

762
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,519
Wasn't the answer Sheldon spot?

763
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,519
Oh, yes, Leonard. Yes, it was.

764
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,519
The coin.

765
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:24,519
Yes, exactly. Where is the coin?

766
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:28,519
Why don't you look in your pockets?

767
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:34,519
I slipped them in there earlier today.

768
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,519
I don't get it.

769
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:43,519
Don't you see when we're all having fun together, we're already winners.

770
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,519
Oh, look, see? Even I'm a winner.

771
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,519
Are you kidding me?

772
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:56,519
This is stupidest thing I've ever heard.

773
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:58,519
You suck.

774
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,519
So hot.

775
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:01,519
Water would be great.

776
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:03,519
You're Lucy, right?

777
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:05,519
I'm a friend of Raj Kutherpolli's.

778
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:08,519
Actually, Amy recognized you.

779
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:16,519
Wow. How's he doing?

780
00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:18,519
Oh, you know, he's good.

781
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:19,519
Great.

782
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:25,519
Yeah, this is none of my business, but why did you break up with him in an email?

783
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,519
Oh, I don't know.

784
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:29,519
I guess I thought it would be easier.

785
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:33,519
Yeah, I get that. I'll go get you your water.

786
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:37,519
When you say easier.

787
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,519
You mean easier for you, right?

788
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:42,519
Because I certainly didn't make it easier for him.

789
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:45,519
Any chance I can get a different waitress?

790
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,519
I'm sorry, this is rude of me. I will get you that water.

791
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:52,519
See, see, see, see.

792
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,519
Just now, you expressed your feelings to my face.

793
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:56,519
How come you could do that with me, but not with Raj?

794
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:59,519
I don't know your email.

795
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,519
You know what the worst part is?

796
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,519
You're sitting here perfectly happy, and he's at home a blubbering mess.

797
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,519
I thought you said he was okay.

798
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,519
Well, I also said I was getting your water.

799
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:10,519
Would look at me still standing here.

800
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,519
You know, I may be a bad waitress, but you are a bad person.

801
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:16,519
Now, you want to hear the specials?

802
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:23,519
Arthur passing away was harder on Sheldon than he's ready to admit.

803
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,519
Really hoping this will cheer him up.

804
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:27,519
Me too.

805
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:31,519
Although it might have been thoughtless of us to make a death star cake.

806
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:34,519
No, it combines two of Sheldon's favorite things.

807
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:38,519
Chocolate chips and the ability to destroy a planet at the push of a button.

808
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,519
Well, anyway, it'll be a nice surprise for the boys.

809
00:37:42,519 --> 00:37:47,519
And how he doesn't think I take his interest seriously, so hopefully this will keep him full for a while.

810
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,519
Okay, let's get the fondant and start decorating.

811
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,519
This is pretty cool. You don't see too many spherical cakes.

812
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:01,519
I wonder why that is.

813
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,519
Hey, guys.

814
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,519
Happy Star Wars Day!

815
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:08,519
Wow!

816
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,519
A death star cake!

817
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,519
We were hoping it might cheer you up.

818
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:15,519
And even though it meant we had to miss the movies, we could still be part of the fun.

819
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,519
Oh, you didn't miss anything. We just started over.

820
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,519
Out of the bitch.

821
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:20,519
Hi.

822
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:21,519
Hi.

823
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:24,519
Look who's here to put the Jew in Jewelry night.

824
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:31,519
Oh, sure, so it's fine when you say it.

825
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:36,519
Sorry, I'm late. I wanted to swing by the lab and pick up some even cooler tools for us to use.

826
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:38,519
I didn't know you were coming again.

827
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:40,519
Last week was a blast.

828
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,519
Plus I thought you might like having a guy here.

829
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,519
Who's not funny?

830
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,519
So what tools did you bring?

831
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:52,519
Everything we need to make Jewelry molds.

832
00:38:52,519 --> 00:38:56,519
Here's some silver or crucible and an unsettling torch to melt it down.

833
00:38:56,519 --> 00:38:58,519
Ooh, that looks like fun.

834
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:02,519
Maybe you should master glue before you move on to fire.

835
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:04,519
Okay, who's that first?

836
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,519
Rajesh, do you want to make a bracelet for your mom to go with the necklace?

837
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:08,519
No tanks.

838
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,519
I was going to make a necklace for my mom, but unfortunately she doesn't have a neck.

839
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,519
She's just chins and fat and feet.

840
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,519
Leonard, do you think I'm funny?

841
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:24,519
No.

842
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,519
You?

843
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:30,519
I think I'm hysterical.

844
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,519
I take it back. That was funny.

845
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:43,519
The philosopher Henri Bergsson says it's funny when a human being behaves like an object.

846
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,519
I bet that bit killed in the chuckle hut.

847
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,519
Oh, he didn't perform stand-up comedy. He was a philosopher.

848
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,519
I think we're zeroing in on your problem.

849
00:39:58,519 --> 00:40:02,519
Perhaps I'll spend some time developing a unified theory of comedy,

850
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:06,519
which will allow me to elicit laughter from anyone at any time,

851
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:09,519
unless they're German, because that's a tough crowd.

852
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,519
Are you set on people laughing with you, because if you're cool with that, you...

853
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,519
You guys have a notice that Emily has a bit of a twisted side.

854
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:25,519
You mean because she has weird tattoos?

855
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,519
No, because she wants to have sex with me in a graveyard.

856
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:32,519
One more time?

857
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,519
She and I were supposed to watch the new Avengers movie tonight, but I was sold out.

858
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,519
So I said, what else do you want to do?

859
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:42,519
She said, let's go to a cemetery and do it on somebody's grave.

860
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,519
Like a random person or somebody she knew.

861
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:50,519
What difference does it make?

862
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,519
Well, if it's her father's grave and they didn't get along, then you know she holds a grudge.

863
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,519
The only issue is that everybody has their own thing.

864
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,519
As long as it's two consenting adults, I guess I don't see the harmony.

865
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,519
Well, if it's one consenting adult and one adult who pretends to consent,

866
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,519
because she's afraid of being alone.

867
00:41:12,519 --> 00:41:13,519
That's a beautiful life.

868
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:14,519
Oh, yes.

869
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:22,519
You got the moon and the trees and Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am.

870
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,519
Makes you feel alive, doesn't it?

871
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,519
So does enjoying a meal at a well-ed restaurant, but here we are.

872
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,519
You aren't scared, are you?

873
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:37,519
Of ghosts? No.

874
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,519
Of you, a little bit.

875
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:41,519
This is interesting.

876
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:47,519
Apparently, a key component in some forms of humor is the element of surprise.

877
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:53,519
Well, I make sense that prefrontal cortex is responsible for planning and anticipation

878
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,519
and patience with brain lesions.

879
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,519
Sheldon, you scared me, that wasn't funny.

880
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:01,519
Maybe you have a stick up your prefrontal cortex.

881
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,519
Okay.

882
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:07,519
The notion that you can read a few books and come up with a definitive theory of comedy is absurd.

883
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,519
I mean, humor is a complex neurological...

884
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,519
Oh, no, no.

885
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:14,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

886
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:16,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

887
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:18,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

888
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:20,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

889
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:22,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

890
00:42:22,519 --> 00:42:23,519
I'm not going to be able to read it.

891
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:26,519
Okay, is her any good?

892
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,519
Any really quit the cheesecake factory?

893
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,519
Yeah. What are you doing today?

894
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:33,519
I don't know.

895
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,519
She already thinks I don't support this, so if I call it, it might look like I'm checking up on it.

896
00:42:36,519 --> 00:42:38,519
Do you support this?

897
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:39,519
Of course I do.

898
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:40,519
She's a great atrism.

899
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,519
How'd she's taking this risk?

900
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,519
That's nice.

901
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,519
You bought that great.

902
00:42:48,519 --> 00:42:51,519
Got a collar before I forget how I said it.

903
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:54,519
Hey!

904
00:42:54,519 --> 00:42:55,519
Hi, what's up?

905
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:57,519
How's it going? You've taken Hollywood by storm?

906
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:59,519
Actually, I'm at the cheesecake factory.

907
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,519
You got your job back. That is great news.

908
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,519
I didn't want to say anything, but you are making the right choice.

909
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:07,519
But to plunge yourself into debt right now would be literally insane.

910
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,519
Yeah, I'm just returning my uniform.

911
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:15,519
And I support you.

912
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,519
You've come to me because you're my Obi-Wan.

913
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,519
I'm not familiar with that.

914
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,519
Is that an internet?

915
00:43:26,519 --> 00:43:30,519
Wow.

916
00:43:30,519 --> 00:43:34,519
You're dead, so I'm going to let that slide.

917
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:38,519
Obi-Wan Kenobi is a character from Star Wars.

918
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:45,519
After his physical demise, he comes to Luke Skywalker as his mentor in spirit form.

919
00:43:46,519 --> 00:43:50,519
Well, that clears that up.

920
00:43:50,519 --> 00:43:55,519
You must be here to give me advice.

921
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:02,519
This is weird.

922
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:09,519
Most of my robes open in the back.

923
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:15,519
Those are your Jedi robes.

924
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:20,519
Oh, wait. What is this?

925
00:44:20,519 --> 00:44:23,519
Be careful with that.

926
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,519
Oh.

927
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:34,519
Oh, no.

928
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:41,519
I need help.

929
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:48,519
I'm going to need a bandage.
