1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Do you see all that controversy with Arnold Schwarzenegger?

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
Because he was saying he'd be willing to use face paint

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,200
for his new role as a tribal warrior.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,160
He said the...

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,359
I'll be black!

6
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:12,599
Yeah!

7
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:24,879
Yo!

8
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:25,719
Yo!

9
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:26,359
Trouble!

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,359
Oh, bro!

11
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,960
Thank God.

12
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,160
Thank God.

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,159
Thank God.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,159
I'm just...

15
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:35,159
You only have to do that a little bit.

16
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,159
Yeah.

17
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:37,159
Oh.

18
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:38,560
Ah, it happened.

19
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Baby?

20
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,560
Not much?

21
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,560
Yeah.

22
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Do you know?

23
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,560
Do you just fill me up?

24
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,560
Yeah?

25
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,560
Here's to you.

26
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:47,560
Happy quanza.

27
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Ah.

28
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
Sizzes paper rock.

29
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,560
All right.

30
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,159
Sizzes paper rock.

31
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,159
Sizzes paper rock.

32
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,359
Yeah, you can go first.

33
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,359
No.

34
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,359
Do you see that little robot from Star Wars got cancelled?

35
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,359
Yeah, he was R2 Meetude.

36
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,759
That was good a lot, that.

37
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:12,759
That little robot?

38
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:14,759
Nautiboy.

39
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:16,759
Nautiboy.

40
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,759
What do you call the wife of the hippie?

41
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760
Mississippi.

42
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Mississippi.

43
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Mississippi.

44
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
OK.

45
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,760
I laughed for that a bit.

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,760
I laughed for that one like 2am last night.

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
That was a good one.

48
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Yeah.

49
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
OK.

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Mark.

51
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Sorry.

52
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
I need to do Mark.

53
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,760
Did you hear about that princess that kissed a frog?

54
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
No.

55
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,760
Died in a cockroach.

56
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Dirty bag.

57
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,760
Dirty bag.

58
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,760
Oh no.

59
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Oh no.

60
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760
Oh no.

61
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,760
My therapist says I should think of mental health like sex.

62
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,759
I always come first.

63
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,759
Can't you?

64
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,759
Pardon.

65
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:19,759
I'm trying not to.

66
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:23,759
Yeah.

67
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,759
Yeah.

68
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:29,759
You know who cares, right?

69
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,759
It's not real.

70
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:33,759
It's not real.

71
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:36,759
I really scream so much.

72
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:40,759
Do you see all that controversy with Arnold Schwarzenegger?

73
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:46,759
He was saying he'd be willing to use face paint for his new role as a tribal warrior.

74
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:49,759
He said, I'll be black.

75
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,759
I'll do it.

76
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:54,759
I'll be black, though.

77
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
Oh, shit.

78
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,759
Oh, shit.

79
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,759
Fuck.

80
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,759
I had to pay three grand for an operation for my dog.

81
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,759
Yeah, it did sound cheap.

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,759
That's so dumb.

83
00:03:16,759 --> 00:03:18,759
Yeah, real frank.

84
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,759
I think you can get you go saffles like a hundred percent.

85
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,759
Oh my god.

86
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,759
Two fat eggs really hard to call that fucking five-boy.

87
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,759
Mm-hmm.

88
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,759
I don't know what it is.

89
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,759
Good boy.

90
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,759
That's a boy.

91
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,759
Let's put tit.

92
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:37,759
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

93
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,759
Look guys, this is how I used to trim my peeps.

94
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,759
I just have a fade, thank you.

95
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,759
Even busy or how's the shop been?

96
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,759
I'm a flat out.

97
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,759
Yeah.

98
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:49,759
But Andrew is here.

99
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:50,759
Yeah, did he?

100
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:52,759
Big boss, big boss on I go.

101
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:53,759
Big boss on that boy.

102
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:54,759
Yeah, George, watch that.

103
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:59,759
But now, with the performance package, 5.0 Ultra, everything's changed.

104
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,759
Thanks to this baby, the normal 5.0.

105
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
Wow.

106
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:08,759
They've taken position grooming to a whole new level with their next-gen dual skin safe blade heads.

107
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,759
Now a company by an upgraded Truman blade and an interchangeable 4 blade to enhance performance.

114
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,759
I'm at the King of England once.

115
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:48,759
If you count a gang bang in an orgy as a meeting, it's sex with the guy.

116
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,759
Is it a top, top, top, top?

117
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,759
Please be top.

118
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,759
Please be top.

119
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,759
You had to go either.

120
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,759
You were the one who did the wrong.

121
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,759
I thought, far.

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,759
Top of the maroon.

123
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,759
We did it.

124
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,759
What's the difference between marijuana and pussy?

125
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,759
If you can smell weed across the room, it's good weed.

126
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,759
Swap.

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,759
Ooh.

128
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:21,759
I think I retracted.

129
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,759
I went to the diarrhea convention the other day.

130
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,759
Boy, did that play stink?

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
He's so bad.

132
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,759
Is that count? That doesn't count.

133
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
That counts?

134
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:36,759
No.

135
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,759
He had like a little giggle.

136
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,759
But on the scale of me laughing.

137
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,759
That's like, yeah.

138
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,759
Just as for me.

139
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:47,759
Ooh, up you now.

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,759
Oh.

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,759
Okay.

142
00:05:52,759 --> 00:06:00,759
I like my women to be like a pair of swim goggles.

143
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,759
So the tight wet and on my face.

144
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,759
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:11,759
I go off and jump off.

146
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,759
You're a graduate.

147
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:19,759
I just drive.

148
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,759
Are you scared of monsters?

149
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:23,759
Yes.

150
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,759
Because he comes the tickle monster.

151
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,759
I'm so sweaty.

152
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,759
Fuck, I can't.

153
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:31,759
I can't.

154
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,759
I'm actually a bit scared of that girl.

155
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,759
I wouldn't have a touching.

156
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,759
Oh my god.

157
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,759
I've taken more shots than an American school.

158
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,759
Okay.

159
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,759
Yeah, these cricket tracks are going to fall real hard with this current.

160
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,759
What the vegetarian...

161
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,759
Fuck that.

162
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,759
Why do vegetarians give a good head?

163
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:05,759
Because they're used to eating nuts.

164
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,759
I didn't laugh either.

165
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:07,759
We're good off.

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,759
Yeah.

167
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,759
No.

168
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,759
He looks like a doing cricket.

169
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,759
I changed it.

170
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:17,759
It needs to eat now.

171
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,759
Why is China so good at cricket?

172
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:24,759
Oh, fuck.

173
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:27,759
They take out every country with one bat.

174
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,759
Oh.

175
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,759
Oh, wow.

176
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,759
What do you call a nun on a bike?

177
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,759
A virgin mobile.

178
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:40,759
I really like that.

179
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:42,759
It's giving me a horde house, like in the Seven Ears world.

180
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:45,759
I was watching a film with my dad.

181
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,759
And I'm like, Dad, is that lady going to die?

182
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,759
He's like, judging by the size of that horse's cock.

183
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,759
Yes.

184
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,759
A painful death.

185
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,759
What the fuck?

186
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,759
That's it.

187
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,759
Pretty much.

188
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,759
What choice have I made last?

189
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,759
My sister is mad at me because of Fakty's girl.

190
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,759
What?

191
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,759
How he had it?

192
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,759
What's that?

193
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,759
My sister is mad because I Fakty's girl.

194
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,759
I wanted on camera.

195
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,759
Take it again, Brian.

196
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,759
What's this?

197
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:36,759
My sister's boyfriend.

198
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:41,759
My sister's boyfriend is mad at me.

199
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,759
My sister's boyfriend is mad at me.

200
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,759
I'm not this girl.

201
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,759
I'm not this girl.

202
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,759
It's going to suck.

203
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,759
I'm getting it like this.

204
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,759
How the fuck are you?

205
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:03,759
The asshole hits Matt like...

206
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,759
He goes boom.

207
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,759
And then just...

208
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:08,759
Oh my god.

209
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:10,759
Let's keep going.

210
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,759
You lost your option.

211
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,759
Why?

212
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:17,759
Why?

213
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,759
Oh, I did it.

214
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:23,759
I fucked the joke before.

215
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,759
Oh, how you doing?

216
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:29,759
I'm training.

217
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,759
I like my women.

218
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:35,759
Like I like my microwave.

219
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,759
Ready to kill any baby I put inside them.

220
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,759
Reheat.

221
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:45,759
Good.

222
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,759
That's good.

223
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:50,759
You can send to your mate David Water.

224
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,759
Why?

225
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:55,759
Why is Johnny Best so so bad at ironing clothes?

226
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:58,759
He's always leaving a crease.

227
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,759
You guys don't get it, but the Krigger fans.

228
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,759
David Water, message Southland.

229
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:11,759
Here's some Krigger truck now.

230
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:14,759
I got it.

231
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:17,759
Oh, it's okay.

232
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,759
Everyone's got that.

233
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:23,759
They're taste.

234
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:28,759
How does a Muslim close it all?

235
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:32,759
It slams it.

236
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:35,759
It slams the door.

237
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,759
That's not good.

238
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:41,759
It's an accent.

239
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,759
Fucking fuck.

240
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:46,759
I'm going to come off to me, man.

241
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:49,759
I'm from via somewhere.

242
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,759
Do you only know Irish accents?

243
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,759
Hey, what do you call a girl standing in the middle of a tennis court?

244
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,759
A net.

245
00:11:00,759 --> 00:11:03,759
Bro.

246
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:06,759
A net.

247
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:09,759
Fuck you, shout out.

248
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,759
My name is for having sex next door.

249
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:16,759
So I knocked and I complained.

250
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,759
Can you be a little bit loud?

251
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,759
Can you be a little bit louder, please?

252
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:27,759
I'm trying to have a wink.

253
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,759
Are you being so slow?

254
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah.

255
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:37,759
This is fucking dope and off.

256
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:39,759
Okay, good.

257
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:41,759
Golf one for you.

258
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,759
Fuck off.

259
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,759
Some people out there like sports.

260
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,759
What does a wanking have in common?

261
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:54,759
Four-pudding.

262
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:55,759
I swear you.

263
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,759
You learn on the green and then you try to get the ball full time.

264
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,759
It's very embarrassing.

265
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,759
It's a golf thingy.

266
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:08,759
The first guy in the art cell we like never leaves.

267
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,759
Fuck you, that's me.

268
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,759
Four-pudding.

269
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:16,759
I'll tell you about four-pudding.

270
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,759
Well, when I was your age, I used to be the four-pudding master.

271
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:27,759
I'm at my first sex wife, 32 or four-pudding.

272
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,759
I once had sex with this guy and he had a full latex cover-all-body suit.

273
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,759
And everything fit him except his glove.

274
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,759
OJ Gibson.

275
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,759
All right, what about this?

276
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,759
That Gibson's.

277
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,759
Here's a show over.

278
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,759
Amy!

279
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,759
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:56,759
What's the difference between a hamburger and a bona?

281
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,759
You're not giving me a hamburger.

282
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:01,759
Hello.

283
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,759
Hello.

284
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:05,759
Good morning.

285
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,759
Yes, that's exactly where my jeans are ripped.

286
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,759
Hey, Matt.

287
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:09,759
Yes, go ahead.

288
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,759
Did you see that there was that Irish guy who got stuck in a river in the Middle East?

289
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,759
Tell me more.

290
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,759
But he wouldn't admit it to himself.

291
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,759
He was in denial.

292
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,759
Oh.

293
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:27,759
In denial.

294
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,759
What's the difference between golf and sex?

295
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:35,759
What?

296
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,759
A bad hole won't get you slap across the face when you play golf.

297
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:44,759
That's slow, that really badly, probably.

298
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,759
What do you get if someone comes in your eye?

299
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:49,759
Good, Dom.

300
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,759
A stick magician.

301
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,759
A stick magician.

302
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,759
That's good.

303
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,759
That's good.

304
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,759
Good time.

305
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,759
That's all.

306
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:09,759
Fucking hell.

307
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,759
You better bottle up five, boy.
