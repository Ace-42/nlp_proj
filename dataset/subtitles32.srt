1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
What do you call it when you fart on another person?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,679
Oh.

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:17,879
Hey!

4
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:19,879
That's a really good one.

5
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,879
Hello!

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:21,879
Oh!

7
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,400
That's too funny.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,359
You're doing some dad jokes.

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,359
Are you ready?

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:27,359
Yeah, I think so.

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,359
You think so?

12
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:29,359
Possibly.

13
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,359
I'm a little bit of a glasses to take them off.

14
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,359
OK.

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,359
All right, you're ready to see this paper rock?

16
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:37,359
Yeah.

17
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,359
OK.

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,359
See this paper rock.

19
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:43,359
See this paper rock.

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,359
Oh!

21
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,359
OK.

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,359
OK.

23
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,359
So go first.

24
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:52,359
Now, why shouldn't you play poker with a plumber?

25
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,359
Ooh.

26
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:57,359
Because a good flush beat a full house every time.

27
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:00,359
Oh, yeah.

28
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,359
Oh!

29
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,359
Oh!

30
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:04,359
Oh!

31
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,359
Got him!

32
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:06,359
It's got to be real.

33
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:07,359
These games, is it?

34
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,359
Well, the thing is games.

35
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,359
Is that true, Tim?

36
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:11,359
Don't know.

37
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,359
No.

38
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,359
Flush doesn't do the full house.

39
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:15,359
OK.

40
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:17,359
What is another use for a woman?

41
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,359
Oh, my fucking god.

42
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:20,359
OK.

43
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:22,359
A finger puppet.

44
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:25,359
Timmy, what the fuck?

45
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,359
Incorrect.

46
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,359
What the fuck?

47
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,359
What the fuck?

48
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,359
Oh my god.

49
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:32,359
Oh my god.

50
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,359
OK.

51
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:35,359
It's so bad of a poker, please.

52
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:36,359
No.

53
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:38,359
It's one of those games.

54
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,359
It's a good job.

55
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,359
It's a good job.

56
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,359
Great job.

57
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:42,359
Yeah.

58
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:43,359
OK.

59
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,359
What do you call a group of disabled people?

60
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,359
A garden.

61
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,359
No, you get it.

62
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,359
A bunch of fucking vegetables, man.

63
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:56,359
Oh!

64
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:58,359
I can get a car.

65
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,359
That's pretty good.

66
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,359
What do you call a sunbatte girl with the yeast infection?

67
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,360
Grill cheese.

68
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,360
Honestly, that ain't even man.

69
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,360
No.

70
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,360
No, it's just healthy.

71
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:22,360
I'm really laughing.

72
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,360
No, it was just the idea I was trying not to throw up.

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,360
Yeah.

74
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm on the coaches.

75
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
I do a proof.

76
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
OK.

77
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,360
What is the only organ in women that stays warm once dead?

78
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,360
Your dick.

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,360
No!

80
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
Thank you.

81
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Or warm up.

82
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Swarm up.

83
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,360
It's just not cold.

84
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,360
What's easier to lift the heavier gets?

85
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,360
A woman.

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,360
What?

87
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Is that a rental letting get it?

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
It's bad joke.

89
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,360
She's easy on her to get it.

90
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,360
Easy to lift.

91
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
That's what it says.

92
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
You wrote it.

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
No.

94
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,360
You thought it was fucking great.

95
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
What's that?

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,360
Pick up.

97
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
Maybe pick up?

98
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
Oh, pick up.

99
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
Oh, yeah.

100
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,360
Oh, yeah.

101
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Oh, yeah.

102
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Oh, yeah.

103
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
That's a great joke.

104
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
That's a great joke.

105
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,360
But I was just kidding.

106
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
That's a great joke.

107
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Don't do it to me, but do it to me.

108
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
You get to get it wrong.

109
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
That's stupid.

110
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
If you get to wrong this time, I'm going to say it.

111
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
No, no, no, no.

112
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,360
Give it to that.

113
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,360
Give it to that.

114
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
Oh, my God.

115
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,360
I'm going to see you.

116
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
Okay.

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,360
What's got a big beard and balls?

118
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,360
To me's mom.

119
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,360

00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,360
Let's remember things we're starting off with the goat of the shaving world.

123
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,360
The Loma 5.0 Ultra.

124
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,360

125
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,360

00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
A precision trimmer.

127
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
A precision trimmer.

128
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
A precision trimmer.

129
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
Because I know how to say this word.

130
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:30,360
A precision trimmer and an updated foil trimmer blade that glides gently over your skin.

131
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,360
Capturing the finest of hairs, giving you some seriously silky smooth hairs.

132
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,360
It also comes with three different comb links and even an LED jewel spotlight.

133
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,360
So you can groom with the precision even in the dark.

134
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Moving on with the beard and balls bundle, we have the beard hedgehog.

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
And guess what?

137
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,360
It's waterproof too.

138
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,360

Yellow in the front, brown in the back.

146
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,360
Oh, that's gross.

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,360
Oh, it's so heavy.

148
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,360
I hate that I laughed at that.

149
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
I thought it was great.

150
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Oh, I envy you, dude.

151
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
I love these two actually.

152
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
This is such a shit combo.

153
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
No, no.

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,360
What do you call a disabled gang member?

155
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,360
A crib.

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Good.

157
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,360
Good.

158
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,360
Yeah, nice.

159
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
What's the worst thing that you could do to a blind person?

160
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,360
Leave a plunger in a toilet.

161
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,360
Oh, my God.

162
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Oh, yeah.

163
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,360
He doesn't remember the ones that he was on the couch all the way.

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,360
Okay, we haven't done this one.

165
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,360
Okay, right.

166
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Kimmy, just say like this.

167
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,360
Kimmy, by watching how.

168
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I'm ready, man.

169
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,360
That's a good one, Seth.

170
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,360
That's a good one, Jimmy.

171
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Jimmy.

172
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,360
No, I'm going to go to one.

173
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
Just say like this.

174
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Jimmy, just say this.

175
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
Jimmy, just say this.

176
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
You're a man.

177
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,360
You're a man.

178
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
I can't do it.

179
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,360
I just told you it's 10 words.

180
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,360
Just say it.

181
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,360
You're about nine to many words.

182
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
What's the worst thing that you can do to your blind best friend?

183
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,360
High five.

184
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,360
That's good.

185
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,360
That's a good one.

186
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,360
That's a good one.

187
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,360
I was really hoping that you'd put your hand up.

188
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,360
But if you did it, you'd put up the joke with none of it.

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,360
It's been worked for me for a memory of you.

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,360
Honestly, to me, you did so.

191
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
To be honest, he rifted.

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
He was like, blind best friend.

193
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I was like, we did not.

194
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Manchin, the best friend in this.

195
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,360
I said, what's the worst thing you can do to a blind best friend?

196
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
High five.

197
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I said, what's the worst thing you can do to a blind best friend?

198
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,360
High five.

199
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
I said, what's the worst thing you can do to a blind best friend?

200
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,360
What's better than winning gold at the Paralympics?

201
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Not being disabled.

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,360
I know.

203
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
I know.

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,360
I thought that would have gotten him.

205
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,360
What's the best part of having a twin?

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Spear parts.

207
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,360
Oh!

208
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
Oh!

209
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,360
Shout out to the best friend.

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
That was great.

211
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,360
That's what he tells the most fucked up jokes.

212
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,360
He's like, hey, what's the best thing about the worst thing ever?

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Like, do I have a problem?

214
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,360
Say it with me now.

215
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Only game parts.

216
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,360
Now let's say it's finished.

217
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Uno, step past.

218
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,360
I'm just wondering which one was meant to be Spear parts.

219
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Bosh.

220
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,360
What?

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
One of them has to be an accident, okay?

222
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
Oh, that's true. That is true.

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,360
It's true. You're not expecting two.

224
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Show that cat system.

225
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
They're not an accident.

226
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,360
Correct.

227
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
What time does an ISIS member go to bed?

228
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Usually crashes around to 9-11.

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
That's...

230
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Play cat.

231
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
That is unru-cat.

232
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
That's unru-cat.

233
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
That's unru-cat.

234
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
That's unru-cat.

235
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
On that topic.

236
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Going.

237
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Can I just...

238
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
I'm just gonna help.

239
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
You can do it.

240
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
I'm just gonna help.

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,360
Go. You can try.

242
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
No, no.

243
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
What's the best way to fade your twins?

244
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Here comes your appointment!

245
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Ah.

246
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,360
Tell me when.

247
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
That's not...

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
You have a sneak, they're like...

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
That's not you.

250
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,360
No, no, no.

251
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,360
She comes to the twins.

252
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Just feel the classic.

253
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,360
Just feel the classic.

254
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,360
Just feel the classic.

255
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,360
Just feel the classic.

256
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,360
That's good. That's good.

257
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Tough to add.

258
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
No, no.

259
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,360
What do you call a disabled supermodel?

260
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,360
Hot Wheels.

261
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Ha-ha-ha.

262
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
No, no, no.

263
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,360
No, no, no.

264
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Oh, yeah.

265
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,360
I saw in the words about that butter.

266
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
Those two close to the chair.

267
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Oh, yeah.

268
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,360
What?

269
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,360
Do you call it when you fart on another person's butt?

270
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,360
A fart plant strain.

271
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,360
I cooked it!

272
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
I cooked it!

273
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,360
Thank you.

274
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,360
It's a fart plant strain.

275
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,360
Fart plant strain.

276
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
Fart plant strain.

277
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Fart strain!

278
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
Swing in.

279
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Say that three times faster.

280
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Fart plant strain.

281
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
Fart plant strain.

282
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
That's a great joke.

283
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,360
That's a good joke.

284
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
That's a great joke.

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
That's a good joke.

286
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,879
I thought it was great. You said fart.

287
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,560
Cheers. Cheers. I was a good owner like that.

288
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
Who?

289
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Don't.

290
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,360
Now with it.

291
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,360
Oh.

292
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,360
Now the shot.

293
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,360
Now the shot.

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
All right.

295
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,360
What do you call a fire ant with severe learning disabilities?

296
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
A fire.

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
A dent.

298
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,360
Oh.

299
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Yeah.

300
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I didn't want to do it.

301
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,360
What's worse than a lobster on your piano?

302
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
You're getting a lot worse.

303
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Crabbs on your organ.

304
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,360
That's a great.

305
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
He got it.

306
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,360
He got it.

307
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
Oh my god. He's telling me.

308
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,360
Oh, yes. He's an egg.

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,360
Oh, he's me.

310
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,360
The biggest Stephen time in the universe.

311
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
He's almost there.

312
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
He had me.

313
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Lobsters on your piano.

314
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah.

315
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
Oh, yeah.

316
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,360
Oh my god.

317
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,360
I've never been more proud.

318
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Lobsters on your piano.

319
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Did you know that every star sign has its own hairstyle?

320
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Except for cancer.

321
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,360
That's the right thing.

322
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,360
And what the fuck's Timmy's is?

323
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Timmy's on stage too.

324
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
All right.

325
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,360
No, no, no. I meant drink.

326
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,360
Yeah, Timmy loved.

327
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Yeah, I loved it.

328
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
Boy, you were.

329
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,360
You see left.

330
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
Shout out to me, said dresser.

331
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
When a deaf girl jacks you off.

332
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
It's technically oral.

333
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
Ah.

334
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
Ah.

335
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Just absolutely.

336
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,360
That's the smartest thing you've ever seen.

337
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,360
It is.

338
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Did you hear about the f*** it?

339
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,360
He came out of the cupboard.

340
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Oh, I got one.

341
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Oh, I got one.

342
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,360
I got one.

343
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,360
I got one.

344
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I got one.

345
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
I got one.

346
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
I got one.

347
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
I got one.

348
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
I got one.

349
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I got one.

350
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,360
That's f***ing good.

351
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,360
You got one.

352
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Say, do it.

353
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Say, do it again.

354
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
You can say, just say, do it again.

355
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Say, do it again.

356
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
Say, do it again.

357
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Did you hear about the half a gay?

358
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,360
Say, what?

359
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Say, did you hear about the half a gay?

360
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,360
He came out of the cupboard.

361
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,360
Guys, it's really good.

362
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,360
You're a f***ing f***ing.

363
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,360
A plightful aprice and children is crashing to earth.

364
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,360
One says, what about the children?

365
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,360
The other says, f*** the children.

366
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,360
The third one says, do we have time?

367
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,360
I think you lost me at one.

368
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,360
I think you lost me at one.

369
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
I lost me at one.

370
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
There's two priests on the whole.

371
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
There's so many planes for a priest.

372
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,360
If the planes full of priests, where are the kids?

373
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
10.

374
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
10.

375
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
10.

376
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
10.

377
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,360
If there's no sense that there's any resistance.

378
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Where the f*** are the kids?

379
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Where are the kids?

380
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
All right, I'll write it in.

381
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Where are the kids?

382
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
All right, time for the draw.

383
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Time for the priests and where are the children?

384
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
I'm okay.

385
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,360
We gotta keep going.

386
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:25,360
What is the first thing that you would do if you woke up as a girl?

387
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,360
The dishes.

388
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,360
That's the most easy thing you were.

389
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,360
I was like this man.

390
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,360
I would like that.

391
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,360
To be laughed for sure.

392
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
That?

393
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,360
No good.

394
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,360
No good.

395
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,360
Actually, no good.

396
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
To be has no idea what it was doing.

397
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,360
So I asked the Toistor manager where the Arnold Schwarzenegger door was.

398
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,360
And he said to me, I'll be back.

399
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
Back.

400
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,360
I thought you were going to say the end word.

401
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,360
I'll be back.

402
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
I'll be back.

403
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I'll be back.

404
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I didn't get it.

405
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
I said, man, got caught fucking a pig.

406
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
Okay.

407
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,360
So they killed the pig.

408
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Where were?

409
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
I got one of the drugs.

410
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
I'm dead fucked a pig.

411
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,360
So they killed the pig.

412
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,360
I didn't even skip over that.

413
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,360
We're taking the same decision.

414
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,360
We're taking the same decision.

415
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
What do I mean?

416
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,360
I'm just...

417
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,360
I'm just...

418
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
What?

419
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,360
What?

420
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,360
What?

421
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,360
I'm just talking.

422
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,360
What?

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm just talking.

424
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,360
What?

425
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
What did he say?

426
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Did he do it?

427
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,360
I didn't do it.

428
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
I did it!

429
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,360
I did it!

430
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,360
I did it!

431
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Dude, what's next week?

432
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,919
Next week he only has prime signs, no setups.

433
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,879
Next week he's like, and the donkey did it.

434
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,879
What does that...

435
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,720
At the two strings left, like he's supposed to.
