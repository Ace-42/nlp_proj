1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Was it a honeymoon couple on a plane?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:04,879
Yeah, there's a couple on a honeymoon.

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:06,600
And the plane hadn't yet taken off.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,200
And the woman who just got married just

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,080
became violently and horribly ill on the plane.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,920
I mean, it was not a pretty little sick bag kind of thing.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,879
It was just like, I'm going to paint with my organs.

8
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:23,760
Like, it was just crazy.

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,280
And people were freaking out all over the plane.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,640
And so they brought a stretcher down,

11
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
they put her on the stretcher and they're wheeling her away.

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,359
And like, her new husband is just kind of cruising along

13
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:36,840
with the thing.

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,280
And he sees me and he's like, Deadpool!

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,240
No way!

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,240
High five!

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,520
And I'm like, I don't want to do you.

18
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,719
Like, what has she got?

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,679
Like, what's happening?

20
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:51,480
You know, like, he's like, let's touch eyeballs.

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,799
No, no.

22
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,480
And by the way, your wife is like half dead.

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:00:57,479
Half her!

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:59,479
Half her, man!

25
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:01,239
So it was just a very surreal moment.

26
00:01:01,239 --> 00:01:02,759
I'm sure they're fine.

27
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:05,319
I'm sure they're on their second anniversary now.

28
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,679
Just kicking it somewhere.

29
00:01:06,679 --> 00:01:12,239
That's such an embarrassing thing I have to be yesterday on the tube.

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,079
So I've always said, you know, like,

31
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,719
oh, anyway, right, basically, what happened more?

32
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,920
So I was stood on Oxford Tube platform.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,679
Yeah.

34
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:24,920
And I've always got, so you know, like, a glass keep cup.

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,120
You know, like, rather than going to a coffee shop and getting a new cup,

36
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,840
I carry a glass one that I then wash and we get my latte.

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
And so I got me empty cup and I just stood up down stuff.

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
And an elderly gentleman was walking towards me on the platform.

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,480
I was just like, oh, God, I just want to get on the tube.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,760
I ain't getting recognised.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,560
And he said what towards me?

42
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
But then he had his arm out and his arm came into my space.

43
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,159
And on the tube, on the platform, it's crowded and it's a bit,

44
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,760
I don't know, I just got the can of light.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,840
Oh, what are you doing?

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,680
A bit aggressive, unnecessarily.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,879
And actually, what I was doing was he went, oh,

48
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,480
sorry, I thought you wanted money.

49
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,680
And he was trying.

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,680
Oh.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,920
He was going to put 10 P in the cake cup.

52
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
LAUGHTER

53
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,039
I knew, and I thought, I was like, yeah, oh, God, oh, man.

54
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,480
Oh, I thought it was true when I just sat there.

55
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:25,399
And I was like, someone make high contacts.

56
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:26,759
So I can tell this story.

57
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,159
I was like, wait, I'm just someone.

58
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,280
I was like, mm-hmm, no, we got really good story.

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,199
Because Dwayne, presumably, you can't hide.

60
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,399
You can't put a hat on.

61
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,679
You can't put a hat on now.

62
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,679
I mean...

63
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:43,239
But yeah, I've seen you in a gym, like a public gym.

64
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:45,599
So do you get to get bothered all the time?

65
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,399
All the time.

66
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,399
Yes.

67
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:48,399
But how do you work out...

68
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,399
The end of the minute he's gone out the window.

69
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:51,679
But how do you work out in the gym if people are constantly giving me up to you?

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,240
Just be nice, say hello, get a moving...

71
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,240
Get a moving.

72
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,680
Lipsome.

73
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,800
LAUGHTER

74
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,360
But fame isn't funny thing, right?

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,960
So that story for you will...

76
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,680
That will be like the constant anchoring reminder, right?

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,120
Of like how cool fame is, but also never like...

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,840
I don't have the stress you have, though, because I think the thing is...

79
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,240
If you are five or six, and you've got a hat on,

80
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,319
and you dress like a...

81
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,319
Most of the time, a teenage boy and a baseball cat.

82
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,319
He's...

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,719
Headphones on, head down.

84
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,039
I catch the bus and the...

85
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,199
I catch the bus in the subway every single day, because...

86
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,400
I'm not in anyone's eye line like that, but I imagine...

87
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,239
You...

88
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:35,479
There is something about...

89
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,319
If...

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,319
If you're...

91
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,319
You can't...

92
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,280
You're seven feet tall, though.

93
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,599
So, yeah...

94
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,280
But Kevin's had weird...

95
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,759
You've had weird fans...

96
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,639
Well, what happens if you're three foot two?

97
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,639
Like...

98
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,639
Wait, how do I say it?

99
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,639
How do you...

100
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,039
How do you do that?

101
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,639
I'm talking about...

102
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:56,639
No, how do you deal with that when you're doing that?

103
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,639
Five, two.

104
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,639
I'm sorry.

105
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,639
I'm sorry.

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,639
I don't think...

107
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,639
Well, first, there's two.

108
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,639
We're skipping around some points here.

109
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:05,639
First thing...

110
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,639
She's saying she's dressed like a teenage boy.

111
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,639
That...

112
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,639
Somebody had to put money in your cup.

113
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,639
It's got to be a lot worse tonight.

114
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:13,639
50 hours.

115
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,639
I'm putting in the little song...

116
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,639
Something...

117
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,639
Something with the near parents said,

118
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,639
I need to help this person.

119
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,639
Make sure they eat today.

120
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,639
Something that...

121
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:27,639
For me, I mean, it's bad.

122
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,639
And because I'm a big deal.

123
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,639
It's...

124
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,639
It's just...

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,639
You know, as I followed, was it in a restaurant where you followed you?

126
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:36,639
Oh, my God.

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,639
I had a guy actually following me into the bathroom.

128
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:41,639
It was a true story.

129
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,639
In the storm, you know, I got to go.

130
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,639
And, you know, a guy while I'm in the bathroom,

131
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:46,639
it's like, can I get a picture?

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,639
And I'm like, you know, because I'm obviously a very big guy.

133
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:52,639
I stand up for myself for me, and they say,

134
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,639
Hey, not in here.

135
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,639
You wait until I'm done, okay?

136
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:56,639
You go outside.

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
I'll take you with you when I get outside.

138
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
And I go on the stall, close the door.

139
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,639
And, you know, you would expect whoever that was

140
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,639
to have left.

141
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,639
They're gone.

142
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
And I, you know, I do what I got to do.

143
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,639
And there was one of those situations

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,639
where I had to be in there for a while.

145
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,639
And I'm in there.

146
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:19,639
You know, literally, you know, when you get comfortable,

147
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,639
you start to take your time.

148
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,639
And I'm on my phone.

149
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,639
I'm scrolling.

150
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,639
You know, it's a comfortable environment.

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,639
That's what you do with the mall.

152
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,639
That's it.

153
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,639
I get done, and I like get out the stall and close the door.

154
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,639
He's right there.

155
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,639
He's like, you're in there for a while.

156
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,639
He's like, can we get the picture?

157
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,639
And I was like, I'm in outside the bathroom, man.

158
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
I'm not taking the picture with you in the bathroom.

159
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,639
But the fact that he stood there, like, very nicely,

160
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:54,639
though, it made me feel obligated.

161
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,639
And I was like, hey, just, just come on, selfie.

162
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,639
I was like, don't tell anybody you saw me in here.

163
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,639
You've been friends with Jason Statham ever since.

164
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,639
Yeah.

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,639
But I'm distracted by the makings of a...

166
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,639
Cocktail.

167
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
Oh, yeah.

168
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,639
It's a cocktail at Christmas, everyone.

169
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,639
Yeah.

170
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,639
You know, cocktail?

171
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:18,639
Shall I?

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,639
Yes, please. Now, what have you brought us?

173
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,639
OK, well, I like to give Britain a little tip every now and again.

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,639
So you need to find yourself a sheath, right?

175
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,639
Now, this is...

176
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,639
Hold on.

177
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:28,639
Hold on.

178
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,639
I don't know if I want dead drink.

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,639
If you go to the really posh cocktail bars,

180
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:36,639
you get these incredible ice cubes that they hand carve.

181
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,639
Oh, no, no, no.

182
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,639
We go get a water bomb, right?

183
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,639
And we just split it, and we peel it off,

184
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,639
and we get a lovely round bear with me.

185
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,639
This is what they do with the posh places.

186
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,639
Then we're going to make a Christmas negroni.

187
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:50,639
I know.

188
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,639
I think of myself as a Christmas negroni.

189
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,639
LAUGHTER

190
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,639
Only you could have said that.

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,639
I couldn't have gone away with that.

192
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,639
So, in the groany, I want you to think of it as medicine, right?

193
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:10,639
OK.

194
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,639
If you've got every one of us has someone a bit boring,

195
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,639
a bit sort of dodgy come into the Christmas party.

196
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,639
There's always one.

197
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,639
So then what you do is you take this negroni, aka medicine.

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,639
Medicine?

199
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,639
Right.

200
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,639
And it turns people that are a bit problematic and boring

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,639
into interesting people.

202
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,639
Whoa!

203
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,639
So, and the groany is 20...

204
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,639
What's Jamie trying to say?

205
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,639
I know.

206
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,639
And he's pouring three drinks.

207
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,639
This is 20 mils of campari, 20 mils of vermouth russos,

208
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,639
which we've sented with a little cinnamon and Christmas fare.

209
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,639
Yes.

210
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,639
And then we have a little gin, a little bit of clementine to get you guys.

211
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,639
Yes.

212
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:50,639
Are you ready for this?

213
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,639
I'm like, come on, man.

214
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,639
Now, once you sip this, if you don't become more interesting,

215
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,639
I don't know what's going to happen.

216
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,639
OK.

217
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,639
OK.

218
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,639
It's going.

219
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,639
Lovely.

220
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:01,639
It's like school.

221
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,639
Yeah, go on.

222
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,639
Oh, we have four.

223
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:04,639
We have four.

224
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,639
No, no, we're...

225
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:06,639
It's here. It's very Christmas.

226
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,639
Merry Christmas.

227
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,639
And this is very Christmas.

228
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,639
This is a bit like a Christmas carol, and we are scrooge.

229
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
Because like, Merry Christmas, everybody.

230
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,639
Merry Christmas.

231
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,639
It's like 600 tiny tins.

232
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,639
Yeah.

233
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,639
OK.

234
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,639
Oh, come on.

235
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,639
Come on.

236
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,639
Oh, that is delicious.

237
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
How come the weld's changing?

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,639
Oh, no.

239
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,639
Be the judge of whether or not it's delicious.

240
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:29,639
No, I like that.

241
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:31,639
It has just enough Christmas in it.

242
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:32,639
Here's the thing.

243
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,639
No, that's very good.

244
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,639
That's great.

245
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:36,639
You want to sit?

246
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:37,639
You want to sit?

247
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:38,639
Hold on.

248
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:39,639
Oh, wow.

249
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,639
Oh, wow.

250
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:41,639
Here we go.

251
00:08:41,639 --> 00:08:43,639
I drank from this side, so you could drink from this side.

252
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:44,639
You could drink from this side.

253
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,639
You got to do it.

254
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,639
You could see what you think.

255
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:48,639
Is this like feeding a gremlin after midnight?

256
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,639
That's good.

257
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:50,639
That's good.

258
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,639
That's good.

259
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,639
That's good.

260
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,639
I'm not mad at you.

261
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,639
Yeah, it's delicious.

262
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,639
It's good, isn't it?

263
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,639
It's nice.

264
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,639
Yeah, that's good.

265
00:08:57,639 --> 00:08:58,639
No, it's delicious.

266
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,639
Try that.

267
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:00,639
We've got our Christmas cocktail.

268
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,639
Oh, okay.

269
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:04,639
Oh, that's good.

270
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,639
Oh, that's good.

271
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,639
Oh, that's good.

272
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,639
Yeah.

273
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,639
Yeah.

274
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,639
Christmas to remember.

275
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:12,639
Yeah.

276
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,639
That was the Christmas O.

277
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,639
The underwater sequence.

278
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,639
Yeah.

279
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,639
That looked hard.

280
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,639
Oh, dear.

281
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,639
That was pretty difficult.

282
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:22,639
Yeah.

283
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,639
Yeah.

284
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,639
A Christmas to remember.

285
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:25,639
Yeah.

286
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:27,639
That was the Christmas O.

287
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:28,639
Yeah, that was pretty difficult.

288
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,639
It was a really technical, probably about a week at Pinewood,

289
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,639
because we shot the film here in London.

290
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,639
It was all underwater.

291
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:39,639
It's a sequence where this sphere falls off a cliff.

292
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,639
She and another actor by the name of Justice are stuck inside of the sphere.

293
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,639
And I'm on the outside of the sphere trying to rescue them as it sinks.

294
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,639
And it was.

295
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:50,639
Water is filling up the gyrosphere.

296
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,639
And at one point, we're completely submerged in water.

297
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,639
Yeah.

298
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:58,639
We spent, I don't know, eight week or eight days or nine days we spent in water.

299
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,639
Yeah.

300
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:02,639
And it was, boy, I'll tell you, they put a lot of chlorine in the water

301
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,639
because you've got a crew of 85 people just pissing this pool.

302
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:07,639
No.

303
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:08,639
Like, no.

304
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:09,639
Never got it.

305
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,639
No, no, no, no, no.

306
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,639
People, we didn't have time for people to pee.

307
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:14,639
So you knew people were peeing?

308
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:15,639
Oh, I'm certain of them.

309
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:16,639
They didn't look the most there faces.

310
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,639
Huh?

311
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,639
People would suddenly just...

312
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,639
Oh, I don't know.

313
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,639
I'm sensitive.

314
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,639
That was good pee face.

315
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,639
That's a good...

316
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:27,639
What am I doing that again?

317
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,639
Thank you for that.

318
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,639
Yeah.

319
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:35,639
She just made me think a little bit.

320
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:37,639
Yeah, just make sense.

321
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:40,639
Yeah, I think I'll do a little bit when you...

322
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:41,639
Well, I mean...

323
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,639
You're not supposed to pee in the pool, but no one got out.

324
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:47,639
And I know, because I was...

325
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,639
I had to be underwater with my eyes open, of course,

326
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,639
as if I could see with my eyes open under water.

327
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:55,639
Chris, did you pee?

328
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:57,639
I actually shit myself.

329
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:00,639
I just go back.

330
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:03,639
Yeah, that's not how I am.

331
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:06,639
Time is money on a movie like this.

332
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,639
But as you were in the water...

333
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:09,639
Mm-hmm.

334
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,639
Well, I was trapped in this gyrosphere.

335
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,639
In your defense.

336
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,639
In my defense.

337
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,639
I just felt this freedom as I was working.

338
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,639
You know what I mean?

339
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:29,639
I just was like really present.

340
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,639
Oh.

341
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:32,639
You didn't pee.

342
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,639
Claire peed.

343
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,639
Yes, Claire peed.

344
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,639
Claire was panicked.

345
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:40,639
Lost it.

346
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,639
Oh, God.

347
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:43,639
Yeah.

348
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,639
She's such a good actor.

349
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:45,639
You're a pro-life man.

350
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,639
Every time you've said that for the last seven months,

351
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:50,639
I'm like, what's the crap you?

352
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,639
I'm just going deeply to shame.

353
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
Oh.

354
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,639
And that's when we team up

355
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,639
and we sort of become best buds on and off screen.

356
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:08,639
And we fight these elemental creatures.

357
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,639
But now, feel me together, Jake.

358
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:14,639
Tom, it sounds like it was quite unsubithetic to you

359
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:15,639
while you were filming.

360
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:18,639
What did you get a little peaky in?

361
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,639
Oh, well, yeah.

362
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,639
We were shooting a scene.

363
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,639
Well, we were shooting a scene.

364
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,639
And I got sick.

365
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,639
I was very nauseous throughout the day.

366
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,639
And in the middle of one of the takes,

367
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,639
I threw up in the middle of the take.

368
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,639
And kept going.

369
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,639
But that's how that's what acting is all about.

370
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,639
I was sitting opposite him.

371
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,639
And I was like, how is he doing that?

372
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,639
He is so good.

373
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,639
He looks so tortured and so unwell and so hurt.

374
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:54,639
And then he basically just had a stomach buck.

375
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
And they actually CGIed the vomit out of the shot.

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,639
But if you look in the movie,

377
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,639
my mouth is just partially open at one I'm kidding.

378
00:13:03,639 --> 00:13:06,639
I was like, how's he going to get it?

379
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,639
I was right there.

380
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,639
Yeah, I mean, that's the Marvel Universe.

381
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,639
It's painting out the vomit.

382
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:14,639
It's all the great chunk.

383
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
But my eyes were so expressive that they had to keep it in the movies.

384
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,639
It's so good to read you the shot, you know?
