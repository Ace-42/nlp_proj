1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,319
The pity gallery over here, dude.

2
00:00:02,319 --> 00:00:05,719
Whoa, the Guru Kintal feels sad.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,320
Oh, let's comfort.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,519
I dropped the water, dayi, Rory.

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,839
Oh, no. I can't see the boss.

6
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:27,039
F***ing.

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,280
That's a good try.

8
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,760
You ready?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,560
Yeah, I'm excited. I'm nervous.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,399
There's always...

11
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:35,000
The two papers, this is rock.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,679
It's because I've always said last time.

13
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:37,640
Papers, this is rock.

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,679
I don't know. Really?

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:39,960
It's his paper, right, though.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,480
Whatever.

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,480
Okay.

18
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,480
You do the top here.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,480
I'll do the...

20
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,480
I'll do the fisting.

21
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,480
LAUGHTER

22
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,079
Nice.

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,079
Nice.

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,079
Okay.

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,079
No, no, no.

26
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:52,920
All right, scissors paper and rock.

27
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,520
Oh, yeee. All right, you can go for us.

28
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,920
All right, it's okay. Let's go.

29
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Let's do this.

30
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:57,920
I always...

31
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,920
I always, always, I'm going to start off.

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,320
Something light.

33
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,320
Okay.

34
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,320
Which means...

35
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,640
No, no, we'll start.

36
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Really?

37
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,320
Personally, I don't think you're going to understand

38
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,519
any of the jokes.

39
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,920
LAUGHTER

40
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,519
Rollin' Chinese.

41
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:15,520
We're going to an Indian.

42
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,520
What do you call Batman when he skips church?

43
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:26,320
I don't know.

44
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,719
Christian Bale.

45
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
LAUGHTER

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,120
You laugh because they laugh because...

47
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,920
Oh, did you actually get it?

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,920
I'm Christian Bale, like you bale on church,

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
because Christian Bale was in Batman.

50
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,920
And...

51
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh!

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
She's really smart.

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
LAUGHTER

54
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
Wow.

55
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Okay, I love those.

56
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
So that's...

57
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Play.

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,920
I'm young and trendy.

59
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,920
No.

60
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,920
Sorry, I'm not old.

61
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Fuck.

62
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
LAUGHTER

63
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Cheers.

64
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,920
Cheers.

65
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,920
Oh, okay.

66
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Oh.

67
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Finally.

68
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,920
What do you call a moose with no name?

69
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,920
I don't know.

70
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,920
A non-a moose.

71
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,920
Hi.

72
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Hi.

73
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,920
That old moose got me to be honest.

74
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,920
All right.

75
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,920
What is a Jedi's favourite computer programme?

76
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,919
A...

77
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,919
Adobe Wan Kunobi.

78
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,919
LAUGHTER

79
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,919
Well, kept it in, kept it in.

80
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,919
That was really good.

81
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:37,919
Did you write that?

82
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,919
Have you seen Star Wars?

83
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:44,919
Just lie.

84
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,919
I've seen it.

85
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,919
I've seen it.

86
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,919
I've seen the Mandalorian.

87
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,919
Oh, um...

88
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,919
Hey, shut up.

89
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:59,919
Shut up, sir.

90
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,919
I'm going to get you sword drunk right now.

91
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,919
All right, so are you saying everyone?

92
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,919
No, I'm going to get you sword drunk.

93
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,919
The even Pat's going to be like, finally.

94
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,919
LAUGHTER

95
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,919
Oh, my God.

96
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,919
Wait, it's not.

97
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,919
LAUGHTER

98
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:19,919
Oh, my God.

99
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:21,919
Excuse me.

100
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,919
Um...

101
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
Okay, I took a riddle in the other day.

102
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,919
Same.

103
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,919
Right.

104
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:29,919
And like, you know how that shit is like so effective?

105
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:31,919
It makes you just get through anything.

106
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,919
Well, I was watching, you know, the programme's 60 minutes.

107
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,919
I watched it in 30.

108
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,919
LAUGHTER

109
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,919
Oh, dear.

110
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,919
I got hit in the head with a cannonball today.

111
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:47,919
Don't even need to finish it.

112
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:49,919
LAUGHTER

113
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,919
I don't know why I love it.

114
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:53,919
You think that's what it's saying to the jokes?

115
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,919
I got hit in the head with a cannonball.

116
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,919
LAUGHTER

117
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:59,919
It's just funny.

118
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,919
LAUGHTER

119
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,919
You can't even stand the poop.

120
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:05,919
You're going to get a poop.

121
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,919
I can't even...

122
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,919
I can't even get a cannonball.

123
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:11,919
LAUGHTER

124
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,919
Generally one time I went to a supermarket

125
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:17,919
and I was like, can I get a...

126
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,919
I can cook.

127
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:21,919
And the lady goes, uh...

128
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,919
Okay, I'll try and find one.

129
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
If she brought me back, a wine cork.

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
LAUGHTER

131
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,919
Where on earth did you pull that from?

132
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,919
All right, I got...

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,919
You ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

134
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
Let's go.

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,919
I got hit in the head with a cannonball.

136
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
LAUGHTER

137
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,919
Ah!

138
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:43,919
Yeah, yeah.

139
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't worry, I'm not hurt.

140
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
It was a soft drink.

141
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,920
LAUGHTER

142
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Okay.

143
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,920
Yeah, it was so much funnier when you just said you got hit.

144
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,920
LAUGHTER

145
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
LAUGHTER

146
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
Mmm.

147
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
What is a DJ called his son?

148
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,920
I don't know what.

149
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
Derrick?

150
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,920
All right, I'm holding it together for this.

151
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
I'll tell you right now, I'm holding it together for this.

152
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
This funnier.

153
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,920
Uh...

154
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
What's blonde, cut in half, and curled up on my bathroom floor?

155
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
What?

156
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,920
My pubes. Thanks to Manscape.

157
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,920

158
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920

161
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
and make it look less like a joke

162
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
and more likely to get strooked.

163
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:37,920
It comes with a law more 5.0, which is dual blade.

164
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,920
That's true for the price of one.

165
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,920
It's a review with a smooth finish that's irresistibly sleek and utterly bare.

166
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
And as women, you know we prefer the bare.

167
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,920
It also comes with the weedwacker 2.0, Eer and North Trimmer.

168
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Hey, Rory, do you both stink?

169
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,920
No, I've got Manscape's crop preserver, the baldie-ordering.

170
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,920
So now might, way in the rock little juntsons, smell like cupcakes.

171
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,920

174
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920

176
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,920
Let's go shave.

177
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,920
I don't have balls.

178
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,920
I do.

179
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
All right, I'm going to turn it up a little bit.

180
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,920
Okay.

181
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,920
I had a wanker for my ex-girlfriend last night.

182
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,920
I know it's wrong, but I still have the keys and she's a heavy sleeper.

183
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I do get it. Who said I don't get it?

184
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Who did that?

185
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,920
That's good. Thank you.

186
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,920
Okay, we're going to play.

187
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,920
Okay.

188
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
No, no.

189
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Who's there?

190
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,920
Rory.

191
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
Rory who?

192
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Rory who sucks.

193
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,920
That's it.

194
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,920
That's it.

195
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
My goodness.

196
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,920
My goodness.

197
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
Brother.

198
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
Brother.

199
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Who wants to get that?

200
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,920
No, I'm not.

201
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,920
I really wanted to say that last bit with such conviction.

202
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,920
Links, I've heard that.

203
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,920
I'm going to go on.

204
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,920
All right, cheers.

205
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,920
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

206
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:34,920
All right, I spent a lot of time preparing this next joke.

207
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Okay.

208
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Which will be ages, because I got here before, like the other day.

209
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
And I've worked on this.

210
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
Yeah.

211
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,920
I know I was hung up this morning, but I really worked on this joke.

212
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,920
Okay.

213
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I actually put gullible on the ceiling.

214
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Oh.

215
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
Oh.

216
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,920
But you looked up.

217
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Yeah, it's part of the self.

218
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
How was that?

219
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
I was like, I'm trying to sell my little look.

220
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:04,920
I think why she didn't look up is because she's like, what is gullible, man?

221
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,920
And what's a ceiling?

222
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I was really hoping I would get you with that one.

223
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
No.

224
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,920
That's because she's like, I'm just going to be honest.

225
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah.

226
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,920
What's the difference between subway and my ex-boyfriend?

227
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
Tell me.

228
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,920
One gives me a foot long and the other gives me only six inches.

229
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Hey.

230
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,920
Oh, only.

231
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
Oh.

232
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,920
Only.

233
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Yeah.

234
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:40,920
That's like, I thought that was big.

235
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm laughing and fucking packed with that.

236
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
That's cool.

237
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Okay.

238
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,920
So the subway gives us six inches, right?

239
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,919
I do that for subway once.

240
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:56,919
You did that for subway once?

241
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:57,919
Yeah.

242
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:04,919
What rapper smells the nicest post-colon?

243
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,919
It was good.

244
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:08,919
I'm all right.

245
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,919
Um, why pig's bad drivers?

246
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,919
Why?

247
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:21,919
Because they hugged the road.

248
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,919
Why is Burruria bad driver?

249
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,919
Because I lost my license in 2017.

250
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:29,919
Because he's a pig.

251
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,919
That's just hit up, hit up, Rory.

252
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,919
With some jokes.

253
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:38,919
I'm on it.

254
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:39,919
I'm on it.

255
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:40,919
I'm on it.

256
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:41,919
Yeah.

257
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,919
Hello?

258
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:44,919
Hello, man.

259
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:45,919
Oh.

260
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,919
Since we're making it personal.

261
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,919
Okay, hang on a second.

262
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:49,919
Do you have a drink?

263
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,919
Since we're making it personal.

264
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:59,919
What do you call an anorexic blonde with a yeast infection?

265
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:01,919
So true.

266
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,919
A quarter pounder with cheese.

267
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,919
Oh.

268
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:09,919
Rory.

269
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:11,919
That's not real.

270
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:13,919
Even this pig wanted that.

271
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,919
That's disgusting.

272
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:17,919
That is disgusting.

273
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,919
Well, this is the half of the jar.

274
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,919
Did you hear about the terrorist musician?

275
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:25,919
No.

276
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,919
He's really blowing up on the music scene.

277
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,919
What's the leading cause of pedophilia?

278
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:32,919
Rory.

279
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:34,919
Sexy kids.

280
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,919
Rory.

281
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:46,919
People are getting confused.

282
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:51,919
These goddamn sexy kids.

283
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,919
Oh, my God.

284
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,919
What do you call it when you pick a fruit off the vine before it's ready?

285
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:00,919
I don't know.

286
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,919
Statutory grape.

287
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,919
Who's going on?

288
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,919
I'm going to do that one.

289
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,919
Do you love eating sprays?

290
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,919
No, I'm scared.

291
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:21,919
Bro, I need to get myself a can in the amount of fireballs I'm going to be having.

292
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,919
Well, since you're not selling footpicks and stuff, what does a blonde word like...

293
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,919
Don't worry, we're going to edit this.

294
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,919
Since you're selling footpicks, what do blondes put behind their ears to make them more attractive?

295
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,919
They're ankles.

296
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,919
Mm-hmm.

297
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:45,919
Ruby.

298
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,919
Oh, yeah.

299
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:54,919
He's like, was that a lot?

300
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:55,919
No, you didn't laugh.

301
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,919
I didn't laugh.

302
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,919
You laughing now, but no.

303
00:12:00,919 --> 00:12:02,919
Oh, my God.

304
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,919
All right, well, cheers to that little party trick I have.

305
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,919
I didn't know you knew about it.

306
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,919
Oh.

307
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:19,919
I'm listening.

308
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,919
Okay, you know, I'm not very good at spelling.

309
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,919
We know.

310
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,919
Well, I was going to say Hogwarts was an absolute nightmare.

311
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,919
In my head, I'm just like, what, you couldn't spell Hogwarts?

312
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,919
I thought it was a worse.

313
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:41,919
I thought that was a worse spell.

314
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,919
Wait, what's that?

315
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,919
To no one knows how to spell expel your armors.

316
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,919
It's not a real word.

317
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:50,919
It is.

318
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,919
Okay.

319
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:55,919
All right, I think you need a drink.

320
00:12:56,919 --> 00:12:58,919
I think.

321
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,919
What's wrong?

322
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,919
Sorry.

323
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:06,919
Do I have black stuff in the mirrors?

324
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,919
It's called African American stuff.

325
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,919
Hey, it's the black mask.

326
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,919
All right, thank you.

327
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,919
I went to a 50 con.

328
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,919
A kick in it.

329
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:27,919
I went to a 50 cent concert last year.

330
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:29,919
I got to go backstage.

331
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:31,919
And he's a really cool guy.

332
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,919
He actually gave me a jumper that he made himself.

333
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,919
I was so impressed.

334
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,919
I was like, gee, unit.

335
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,919
I don't get it, but I'm laughing because they're laughing.

336
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:46,919
I have so many explain.

337
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:48,919
So gee, unit.

338
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:50,919
Oh, gee.

339
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:52,919
You guys have been busy with it, you know.

340
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,919
I've been to his signals.

341
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:55,919
I've been to his G unit.

342
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,919
G unit was like the group that 50 cent was a part of.

343
00:13:58,919 --> 00:13:59,919
On a ride.

344
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,919
They came out about three years before you were born.

345
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,919
It's like 2006.

346
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,919
2006?

347
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,919
I was like, two.

348
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,919
No, those are the odd.

349
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,919
Sorry.

350
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,919
Okay, what did 50 cent do when he went to dinner?

351
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,919
Fiddy eight.

352
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:18,919
Fiddy eight.

353
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:21,919
What do you call a Rackahose half black half white?

354
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:22,919
I don't know.

355
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,919
50 percent.

356
00:14:24,919 --> 00:14:25,919
Oh.

357
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:28,919
Get him back with another video.

358
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:30,919
Oh, we got a video.

359
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:33,919
You got a video.

360
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:35,919
No, we got a video.

361
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:37,919
Everybody drinks.

362
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,919
Everybody drinking for Fiddy.

363
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,919
Fiddy say, I'm all Fiddy nor Ditty.

364
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,919
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

365
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,919
Pat's like, maybe.

366
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,919
Pat's in his...

367
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,919
Pee-ho-dee.

368
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:58,919
What are people saying when they see me with staff?

369
00:14:58,919 --> 00:15:01,919
Oh my god, another interracial couple.

370
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,919
That's just no white.

371
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,919
Oh my god.

372
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:10,919
Oh my god.

373
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,919
The couch is coppened, straced, is it?

374
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,919
That's very true.

375
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,919
And I'm like, are you okay?

376
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:24,919
A blonde is doing a jigsaw puzzle

377
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,919
when a boyfriend walks in and asks,

378
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,919
what are you doing?

379
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:31,919
She says, it's a jigsaw you idiot.

380
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:34,919
And he goes, what's it supposed to be?

381
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,919
And she pulls out the box and goes, it's a rooster.

382
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,919
And he says, oh babe, let's put the conflict back in the pack-in.

383
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,919
That's a bad joke.

384
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,919
That's a bad joke.

385
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,919
Oh, okay, that was good.

386
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:53,919
I reckon that's the best blonde joke I've heard.

387
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,919
Like, this whole time.

388
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:57,919
That was clever. Did you write that?

389
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:59,919
Well, what kind of book?

390
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,919
Malfa Frusty's, man.

391
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,919
Oh my god.

392
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,919
I hope we get a throw up on camera, hey?

393
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,919
Oh, no, I got it. I did it.

394
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:15,919
Yeah, I did something.

395
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:17,919
I did something.

396
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,919
I know, it's joke.

397
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,919
Have you ever been so ham-ed you can't see?

398
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,919
Yeah, well wait until you meet my ex-boyfriend.

399
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:35,919
I didn't love it.

400
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,919
I didn't love it.

401
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:39,919
Sorry, man.

402
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,919
What was that mean?

403
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,919
It was like, oh, so ham-ed you can't see?

404
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,919
He's punching in the face.

405
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:47,919
It's between the blind and the blind.

406
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,919
It's good that none of the guys got that joke.

407
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,919
It's a blind joke.

408
00:16:55,919 --> 00:17:01,919
Someone needs to go check on his Mrs. See if she's still breathing.

409
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,920
The blonde is standing on one side of the river

410
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:09,920
when she sees another blonde on the other side and she yells out,

411
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,920
how do you get over the other side of the river?

412
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,920
And the other blonde says,

413
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,920
don't be stupid, you're already there.

414
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,920
What?

415
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:25,920
It's okay, it's okay, babe.

416
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Wait, she's like seeing a something in reflection.

417
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,920
No.

418
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,920
What?

419
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,920
What is that sauce?

420
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,920
What is that sauce?

421
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,920
What is that sauce?

422
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Oh, okay.

423
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I'll tell you what, these feet picks, Bennistad Sella.

424
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,920
You're doing amazing things.

425
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,920
How do you know what a blonde is used to your computer?

426
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,920
The joysticks wet.

427
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,920
For girls.

428
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,920
I have a new guy.

429
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,920
Okay, mine is her.

430
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,920
I feel like Bennistad is actually getting real angry, I mean.

431
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,920
I don't get a blend.

432
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,920
So what?

433
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:23,920
I don't get wet.

434
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,920
But you should use men's tape.

435
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,920
With their refreshing New Deodre and skincare routine.

436
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,920
Uh, um,

437
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:41,920
what do you call a dinosaur that crashes a bus?

438
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,920
What?

439
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Tyranosaurus Rex.

440
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,920
Okay.

441
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:55,920
This is funny.

442
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
How did that happen?

443
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
That's it?

444
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Where are you?

445
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Why am I crying today?

446
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Oh, okay guys, I got to...

447
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,920
The pity gallery over here, dude.

448
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:15,920
The Guru Kintal feels sad.

449
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
Oh, let's comfort.

450
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,920
And Patins are right as well.

451
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
The cheater, I don't know.

452
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,920
driver.

453
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
It's sad to have fun.

454
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Okay, where are you?

455
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Who?

456
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Spice rule.

457
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I'm thinking it.

458
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
I'll get out.

459
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
What about?

460
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
I'm sorry.
