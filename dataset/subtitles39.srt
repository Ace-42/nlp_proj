He's a girl.

182
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
In general, he should be actually...

183
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Oh.

184
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
Welcome to the party, baby.

185
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Then why didn't you get me in this area?

186
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
This is so much fun, dude.

187
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
What the fuck?

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
We miss one.

189
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
No, that was the best one.

190
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,200
He was the same.

191
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,200
Two years of gush.

192
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Oh.

193
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
That's the idea.

194
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,200
Where is the six-wet up?

195
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Stop there.

196
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,200
It gets real dark after that.

197
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,200
That is...

198
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
That's sad.

199
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
That's sad.

200
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,200
That's sad.

201
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
That's the winner, everyone.

202
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Um...

203
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
Hey, what's German?

204
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
What's German tea?

205
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
I'm just fucking saying it, right?

206
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Oh, he was...

207
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
Four-digit pin number.

208
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Nine-nine.

209
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
It was seven-three-two.

210
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Yeah, yeah, he fucked up.

211
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
He never got into his accounts because it didn't exist.

212
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Oh, blah.

213
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
Yes, he was nine-nine-nine.

214
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
Not the fuck.

215
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Nine-nine-nine.

216
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
I win 13.

217
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Okay, but they're here.

218
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
No, no, no.

219
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
I go one-the-one.

220
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
I can't fucking prepare.

221
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Okay, okay.

222
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I'm gonna keep it, man.

223
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
You just did one.

224
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Huh!

225
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Uh...

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,200
What's something...

227
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Something that would take a 24-year-old around the world

228
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
but do absolutely nothing for a 25-year-old.

229
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,200
What is something that would take a 24-year-old around the world?

230
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Yes, but do absolutely nothing for a 25-year-old.

231
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
Wow.

232
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
He's birthday.

233
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
Leonardo DiCaprio.

234
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Yeah, that's funny.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Yeah.

236
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
Yeah.

237
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,200
He like him, young.

238
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,200
What do Lord of the Rings?

239
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,200
What does Lord of the Rings and broke back mountain haven't common?

240
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
What?

241
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Someone's ring got destroyed.

242
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Hey, hey, why did Bilbo have a boat or any sphere?

243
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,200
He has old hobbits die hard.

244
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Thank you.

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
Thank you.

246
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Let's get deep.

247
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
Congratulations.

248
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Yeah!

249
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,200
We're the Aswan Opa!

250
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
What do you mean?

251
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
That doesn't happen.

252
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
I got two from two.

253
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
You sat on there.

254
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
Every teeny-luck, what happened at the end of this?

255
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Come here in the section.

256
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,200
Cheers. Great game, man.

257
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
I can love this place.

258
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,200
That's good fun.

259
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
All right.

260
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Thank you so much.

261
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
I'm going to go lie down for a little bit.

262
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
No, I'm not.

263
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
Let's keep going, baby. This show ain't stopping.

264
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
So lunch now?
