1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
What's the biggest city in America?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:04,799
A B city.

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,280
What's up?

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,920
North chemistry, don't you?

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,920
North chemistry.

6
00:00:27,879 --> 00:00:29,160
Should we see the paper right here?

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Yeah, we can do that.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,640
Let's go. One, two, three.

9
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,399
North chemistry.

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,399
North chemistry.

11
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,719
You're going first.

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:38,719
I'll go first.

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:39,399
All right.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,719
Let's start off with a little silly one.

15
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,439
A little silly one.

16
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:44,439
Why do they call them sausage rolls?

17
00:00:44,439 --> 00:00:44,960
Why?

18
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,719
They don't go anywhere.

19
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,320
They should be called sausage steels.

20
00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:50,400
They come at my ass.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,000
I don't know.

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm so sorry.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,679
I wrote your silly little joke.

24
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,559
Sorry.

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,559
I'll just go with the whole thing.

26
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:05,319
You silly sausage.

27
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,159
I think I'll start with a silly one as well.

28
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,519
I'll go with a silly one.

29
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,599
What's big and what and will kill you if it falls out of a tree?

30
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,599
Cat.

31
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,400
A fridge.

32
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,240
It's not that silly.

33
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,240
It's not that silly.

34
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,080
That's not that silly.

35
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
That's not silly.

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,920
All right.

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,240
Did I?

38
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,880
Yeah, you left it the path thing.

39
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
Oh, yeah, I did, yeah.

40
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Damn it.

41
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,120
I got so high the other night I gave my cat cocaine.

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,560
We did a few lines.

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
Yes.

46
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,080
Meow.

48
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,600
Nice.

49
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,080
Nice, that's for you.

50
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah.

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,280
Dude, I wrote that and I was like...

55
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,079
What's a racist favourite porn side?

57
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
What?

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Everyone thinks I've got that racist shit?

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
There's a few actually.

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
You must be familiar with only clans.

63
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,280
Are these both?

65
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,680
It's not WWE.

66
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
It's KKK.

69
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,680
That was...

71
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,680
Forward slash a slave.

74
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,680
I didn't make it.

75
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Two guys are walking down the street

76
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,680
and they come across a dog lick in its balls.

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
One guy goes,

78
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
which I could do that.

79
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
The other guy went,

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
and he should probably just pet it.

83
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Oh, that's great.

84
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,680
No.

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
We're gonna be maggot, dude.

86
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,680
What do you call a lesbian on fire?

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
An LGBTQ.

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
It was just good.

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm back, baby.

93
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
Oh, the sausage.

94
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,680
Oh, the sausages touch.

96
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Oh, right.

97
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,680
I shaved my pubes into a Hitler mustache.

99
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,680
I call my penis the dictator.

103
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,680
That was for me. That was for me.

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,680
It's definitely not second size.

107
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
Oh, it's a skee.

109
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,680
Can we say it? Can we see it?

111
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
No!

113
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
It just looks like my film.

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
Oh my god!

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,680
That's what Chee said.

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
Chee's.

118
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
That Chee.

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Love you, bro.

122
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,680
Why do sharks never worry about hackers?

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Why not?

124
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,680
Because they got Surfshark VPN to protect their finformation.

125
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,680
That's an awful joke.

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
But if you want to hide your jokes, you can use VPN.

127
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Surfshark VPN will allow you to access internet across the globe.

128
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,680
For any website that you would like to go to, whether it's your favourite shows,

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
internet that you can't get in your country.

130
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,680
Because I've been looking at a lot of stuff that I don't want my government to know about.

131
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,680
Even Surfshark can't monitor what you do online.

132
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Surfshark will allow you to connect as many devices as you want under one account.

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
Whether you're using your phone, laptop or robot vacuum, Surfshark has got you absolutely covered

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
and you don't need to worry about protection.

Jump in a Surfshark today for 30 days.

138
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
What?

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,680
So use the code Yeah Man.

140
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,680

141
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Oh, use the QR code.

142
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,680
Floating around here.

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
That's the...

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
It's the QR code.

145
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Just get Surfshark.

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,680
How do terrorists feed their children?

147
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Oh no.

148
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Here comes the airplane.

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,680
And here comes the second one.

150
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:45,680
Oh, that's you.

151
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,680
That's you, ok Mr. Bob?

152
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
Oh, I just got that.

153
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Oh, dude.

154
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,680
Jesus.

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,680
Oh, dude we drank this quick.

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
I might need a bucket bro.

157
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Oh, dude, I picked up my bike.

158
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,680
That was shammer pants.

159
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I didn't actually shoot my pants, but...

160
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,680
It looks like you guys have just come back from safari.

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
What is this?

162
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,680
An Englishman, a racist and a junkie walking to the bar

163
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,680
and the bartender goes, hey Rory, what can I get you?

164
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
That news comment?

165
00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:03,680
A pervert, a brown galley and a loser walking to a bar.

166
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:11,680
Thank you.

167
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,680
Oh, why is Rory here picking on you?

168
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,680
You said stop bullying me, having an army of Indian followers will comment.

169
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I thought I'm so scared.

170
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Rory sucks!

171
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,680
No, that was good, that was funny, I like that.

172
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,680
What do you call a low budget terrorist attack?

173
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:47,680
7-11.

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,680
My wife got me jerking off to an optical illusion.

175
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
I said babe, it's not what you think.

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,680
No, I fucked it up, let me do the get.

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
How is that?

178
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,680
It's an additional punch.

179
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,680
No, it's not an additional punch.

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:17,680
Dude, a shot that goes outside, a kill looks weird.

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm saying double, I thought I was the best both of them.

182
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Oh, it's just kind of sad.

183
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,680
What is Ireland's favorite indoor sport?

184
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
What?

185
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Domestic violence.

186
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,679
I'm scared.

187
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,679
I'm gonna kill him.

188
00:08:55,679 --> 00:09:01,679
I just...

189
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,679
I just need to say that you can't get off there.

190
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,679
They say that sex, during sex, let me start again.

191
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,679
Fuck, man, sex, during sex.

192
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,679
You burn off as many calories as running eight miles.

193
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,679
Who the fuck's running eight miles in 30 seconds?

194
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:27,679
I'm sorry.

195
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,679
Look, I started running, okay?

196
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,679
I started running and I finally made it to 30 seconds.

197
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:38,679
What's the biggest city in America?

198
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,679
Obesity.

199
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,679
I'm gonna kill him.

200
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:51,679
Dude, I need one of these orange ones.

201
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:53,679
Fuck, you already poured it, dude.

202
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:57,679
First, you got 100.

203
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,679
I had a horrible week, man.

204
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:00,679
My wife died.

205
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,679
My dog ran away.

206
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,679
My house spanned down.

207
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:06,679
Which one of your wives?

208
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,679
That's not a good one.

209
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,679
I had a horrible week, man.

210
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:12,679
My wife died.

211
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,679
My dog ran away.

212
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,679
My house spanned down.

213
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,679
The only thing positive was my AIDS test.

214
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,679
Dude, I'm one point away.

215
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:24,679
I'm not laughing, dude.

216
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,679
I'm one point away.

217
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:27,679
I'm one point away.

218
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:29,679
I'm gonna go up to my door and read, dude.

219
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:31,679
I'm one point away.

220
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:33,679
I'm like, what am I going to do?

221
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,679
I feel like New York and the Matrix just dodged in Giggle Stood.

222
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,679
Is that a Giggle?

223
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,679
Is that a Giggle?

224
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,679
Keep hitting me, dude.

225
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,679
Why does the Titanic and your mum's food have in common?

226
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:55,679
A lot of drowns seeming.

227
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:06,679
Yeah, I was there watching.

228
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,679
I fucked that up, actually.

229
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,679
That was not the right one.

230
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,679
Well, I'll do it to that one.

231
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,679
Dude, you've done like 100 miles of me.

232
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,679
I'm so happy with these.

233
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,679
A lady goes to the doctors with lettuce sticking out of her underpants.

234
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,679
I haven't finished it yet, but I feel like I just won.

235
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,679
A lady goes to the doctors and there's lettuce sticking out of her underpants.

236
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,679
The doctor goes, oh, that's a strange one.

237
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,679
The lady goes, oh, it's just the tip of the iceberg.

238
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,679
Yeah.

239
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,679
Mum, mum, mum.

240
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,679
There you go.

241
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,679
They say that animals can sense disasters before they happen.

242
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,679
That's why my dog always barks every time it sees an Asian getting a car.

243
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:02,679
That's not funny, I respect Asians.

244
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:03,679
That's funny!

245
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,679
I just got back from Japan, I love the people.

246
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,679
You head about the disease you get from kissing birds.

247
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:14,679
Cherpes.

248
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,679
It's untweetable.

249
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,679
What are these places?

250
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,679
You have like a salad on the...

251
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,679
Hi, you're cherpes.

252
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,679
It's an outdated joke, it's called X, now dickhead.

253
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:30,679
Is it?

254
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:32,679
Oh, tweet.

255
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:35,679
I thought the Cherpes is an actual X.

256
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,679
I'm going to back over the X.

257
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,679
Is it you made me laugh from just being a dumb...

258
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,679
This is f***ing the X!

259
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:52,679
The worst thing is, Matthew Yonsi is coming to this...

260
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,679
She is a heavy scar.

261
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:00,679
It's like, well, it's like 11th at the morning,

262
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,679
and she's going to buck up in an hour,

263
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,679
and she's like, how is the gig going to be like?

264
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:06,679
It's been pretty good!

265
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,679
You're...

266
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,679
You're all screaming!

267
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:13,679
You're all screaming!

268
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,679
I'm so scared!

269
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,679
I'm so scared!

270
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:20,679
It's white privilege.

271
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,679
It's white privilege.

272
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,679
I need a hype and a hug.

273
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,679
I need a hype and a hug.

274
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:30,679
I need a hug.

275
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:32,679
It's sad.

276
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,679
Oh my god.
