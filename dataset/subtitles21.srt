1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I've had a really good time tonight.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Mm.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know, I rarely connect with someone

4
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
this much on the first date.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Me neither.

7
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I've had a really good time, too, you know.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Mm.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Are you going to eat that bread?

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh, I just like the smell.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Mm.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You make me laugh.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Can't you write to move over to the couch?

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Mm-hmm.

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Maybe I'll just turn down the lights a little.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
How about all the way?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Okay.

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Wow, cool poster.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Or should I say, Guruvy poster?

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So, uh, where are we?

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Are those your teeth?

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh, you can see them, huh?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, they're insanely white.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I did that for you.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What's it matter with you?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
It's a matter with me.

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You've got a black light.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's 1999.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, my God.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The peaches are stuck together.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Chandler.

32
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Oh, my God.

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
She made half an English trifle and half a shepherd's pie.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Uh-huh.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, this is so good that I'm going to go enjoy it on the balcony.

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
So that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I got to call my friend, Maddie, and tell her how good this is for Monica's room.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'll help you, Donald.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm going to go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror as I eat it.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, now what was that all about?

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Is it does it not taste good?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Let me try it.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No, no, no.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, pun.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're so good.

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Maybe Chandler has some laugh.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It tastes like feet.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I like it.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Are you kidding?

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What's not to like?

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Custard good.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Jam good.

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Meat good.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So a bird just grabbed it and then...

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And they're trying to fly away with it.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
And then just dropped it on the street?

57
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, but if it's any consolation before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Hey, I hear that you and Joshua are going out to dinner with Ross and Emily, and I think that's...

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I think it's really cool.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yeah, Rachel, I think you're handling that really well.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Handling it?

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
They're handling it.

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
There's nothing to handle.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You know, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasn't for me and Joshua.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You know, they're not going to get married anyway.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What?

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Come on.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They rushed into this thing so fast. It's ridiculous.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I mean, they're going to be engaged for like what?

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A year.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Somewhere along the way, one of them is going to realize what they've done and they're going to call the whole thing off.

72
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm telling you, you're going to be dancing at my wedding before you dance in the thairs.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yeah, well, I don't dance at weddings.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why not?

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Because weddings are a great place to meet women.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And when I dance, I look like this.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
LAUGHTER

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Hey, man.

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
So, what are you guys doing four weeks from today?

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Nothing.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Nothing.

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am...

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
...free.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Great, because Emily and I are getting married in a month.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What?

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yep.

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
In a month?

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yeah.

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You mean you've been 30 days?

90
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

91
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
From now?

92
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yeah.

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's great.

94
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yeah.

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where's Rachel?

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
She and Phoebe took the stripper to the hospital.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
LAUGHTER

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel?

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What?

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where was this?

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
1987.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The weekend you guys visited me at school.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Oh my God, that's wild.

104
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.

105
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What? It matters to me.

106
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why?

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Because the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
for the very first time.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You kissed her that night too?

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Two guys in one night?

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, I thought she became a slut after she got a nose fixed.

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
LAUGHTER

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Seriously, where did this happen?

114
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
OK.

115
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
After you told me she was passed out in our room,

116
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I went in there to make sure she was all right.

117
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
She was lying up my bed, all buried in people's coats.

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Well, I went to kiss her on the forehead.

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You know, but it was so dark I accidentally got her lips.

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I started to pull the lay, but then I felt her start to kiss me back.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It was only for a second, but it was amazing.

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And now, now I find out that you kissed her first.

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh, wait.

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What bed did you say she was on?

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Mine.

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm pretty sure I put her on my bed.

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
No, she was definitely on my bed.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Why would I kiss a girl and then put her on your bed?

129
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, then who was on my bed?

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Oh, oh, oh!

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No, no, no!

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh!

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You were under the pile of coats?

134
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I was the pile of coats.

135
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
LAUGHTER

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, my God!

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You were my midnight mystery kisser!

138
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You were my first kiss with Rachel?

139
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You were my first kiss ever!

140
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What did I marry into?

141
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're going to split it. You take half and I take half.

142
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Well, that's not very worthy of some.

143
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, though, not. You know what? I think Monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy.

144
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
What do we use to split it?

145
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
OK.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
All right. Pick a half.

147
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK. Well, this side looks bigger.

148
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think there's more of crust on this side.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah. So...

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Maybe if I measure it.

151
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, my God, say just pick a piece.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
All right, pick that.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So the smaller piece.

154
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Oh, OK.

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
There you go.

156
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Enjoy your half, my friend, but that is it.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
No sharing, no switching, and don't come crying to me.

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you eat your piece too fast,

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
FUN!

160
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh!

161
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh!

162
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh!

163
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh!

164
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right, you got to give me some of your pieces.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, no, no. No switching, no sharing. Don't come crying to me.

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I may just sit here and have my kick all day.

167
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just sit here and hollet and eat my...

168
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, OK. Look, there's a piece of dust on our floor on it.

169
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Just stick to your side.

170
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Come on now.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:13,000
All right. What do we have?

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I took care of everything. Thanks a lot, co-host.

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Good.

174
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Take care of everything. There's plenty of things for you to do.

175
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Uh-huh, like what?

176
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cups!

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Cups? You're giving me cups?

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
And ice?

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Cups and ice? Oh, I get to be in charge of cups and ice?

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
All right.

181
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Fine. OK, I will be in charge of cups and ice.

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wait a minute. I can get ice at the restaurant.

183
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I got it on!

184
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Hey, check it out.

185
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A cup hat, a cup banner, cup chandelier,

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
and a thing that started it all. The cup.

187
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Great job with the cup, Steve.

188
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Why don't you just go out with it?

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
And did you notice the ice?

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Look, we have it all.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
We have crushed, cube, and dry.

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Watch. Oh.

193
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Mystical.

194
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I don't want to eat my Tuscan finger food because they're all filling up on a Phoebe snowcoast.

195
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
They're snowcoast?

196
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Snowcoast.

197
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You'll go. Go. Thank you.

198
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I got these pants and burning up.

199
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What is she trying to kill me? It's like a volcano in here.

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Are you hot?

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

203
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
OK, must just be me then.

204
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That was just the pants and the couch.

205
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, go ahead.

207
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Thanks.

208
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Hey, do you mind if I use your bathroom?

209
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Oh, go ahead.

210
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Thanks.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh.

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh.

213
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh.

214
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh.

215
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh.

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hey, my favorite part is coming up.

218
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
OK.

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh.

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Oh.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Oh, my God.

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hello.

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Uh, Chandler's not here.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Well, you can help me.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
OK.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Listen, I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

229
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Nice.

230
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
No, I got really hot in my leather pants, so I took them off,

231
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
but they must have shrunk from the sweat or something

232
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
or my legs expanded from the heat.

233
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I can't get them back on, Joey.

234
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't.

235
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, that is quite a situation.

236
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you see any powder?

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Powder, yeah. Yeah, I have powder.

238
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Good, good, OK.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sprinkle some of that on your legs.

240
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It'll absorb some of the moisture, and then you can get your pants back on.

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, hold on.

242
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, man.

243
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You see any, uh, uh, Vaseline?

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh.

245
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I-

246
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, man.

247
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't know.

248
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I don't know.

249
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't know.

250
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I don't know.

251
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, Vaseline.

252
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I see lotion.

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I have lotion without work.

254
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, sure. Throw some of that on there.

255
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hold on.

256
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Uh.

257
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Oh.

258
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Oh.

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ross, you OK?

260
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm still- there's still not coming on, man.

261
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And the lotion and the powder have made a paste.

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Really?

263
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Uh, what color is it?

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What?

265
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Different. Does that make-

266
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Well, I'm just- if the paste matches the pants,

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you can make yourself a pair of paste pads,

268
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
and she won't know the difference.

269
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Joey, do you have a minute?

270
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Dude, what am I gonna-

271
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Rachel's here, so good luck, man.

272
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.

273
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Uh, well, your timing couldn't be better.

274
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am putting out fires all over the place, man.

275
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Ross, um, you've been in there for a long time.

276
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
All right, I'm coming out.

278
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, let's just leave the lights on.

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh, my God.

281
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I had a problem.

282
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I took the quiz and it turns out I do put career before, man.

283
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Get up.

284
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What?

285
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Here, my seat.

286
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
How was this your seat?

287
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Because I was sitting there.

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
But then you left.

289
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, it's not like I went to Spain.

290
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I went to the bathroom. You knew I was coming back.

291
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What's the big deal? Said someone else.

292
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The big deal is I was sitting there last.

293
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So, it's my seat.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Actually, the last place you were sitting was in there, so-

295
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You guys, you know what? You know what?

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It doesn't matter.

297
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Because you both have to go get dressed before the big vein in my head pops.

298
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So-

299
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing.

300
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Really quickly, it's not a big deal. Get up!

301
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
All right, fine. You know what? We'll both sit in the chair.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Fine.

303
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm so comfortable.

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Me too.

305
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable.

306
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
All right.

307
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay, look, we have 19 minutes, okay, Chandler?

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I want you to go and change, okay?

309
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
And then when you come back, Joey will go change,

310
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
and he'll have vacated the chair, okay?

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Okay.

312
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
All right, fine. I'm going.

313
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Where I get back is chair sitting.

314
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And I'm the guy who's sitting in a chair.

315
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,000
All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I in turn have noticed that you are not.

317
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
So in the words of A.A. Milne, get out of my chair.

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Deal whole.

319
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Okay.

320
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What are you doing?

321
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
We said I had to give you the chair.

322
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You didn't see anything about the cushions?

323
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The cushions are the essence of the chair.

324
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
That's right.

325
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm taking the essence.

326
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, he'll be back.

327
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, there's nobody in the room.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Where's my underwear?

329
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Come on, come on, what? You took his underwear?

330
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
He took my essence.

331
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Okay, hold on.

332
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Joey, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?

333
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Because I'm not wearing it any underwear now.

334
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?

335
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's a rented tux, okay?

336
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not going to go command on another man's for teens.

337
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Well, then it looks like somebody's going to have to give somebody back his cushions.

338
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Okay.

339
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You hide my clothes.

340
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm going to do the exact opposite to you.

341
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
What are you going to show me my clothes?

342
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Okay, opposite is opposite.

343
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
He's got nothing.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Okay, buddy, boy, here it is.

345
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
You hide my clothes.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm wearing everything you want.

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Oh, my God.

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
That is show not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear.

349
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Look at me. I'm Chandler.

350
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

351
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Maybe if I wasn't going commando,

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll tell you, it's hot with all this stuff on.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I better not do any, I don't know, lunges.

354
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm going to stop you right there, Linda.

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Okay.

356
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Does it look like this is my first time?

357
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,000
No, I want four twos, and I want them all on my back.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Okay.

359
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Wait a minute, there's two sets of mazzels. Which one is it?

360
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Which one is it?

361
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What is it?

362
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Son of a bitch!

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Dude, it's Chandler, let me in.

364
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Go away.

365
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't want to see anybody.

366
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.

367
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Really?

368
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Did you count, Mrs. Simpoli?

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're not tan? No, I just had to get a picture of this.

370
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How she here later?

371
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Pass the cheese, please.

372
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh my god, you can't even look at me, can you?

373
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No.

374
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey, it's BB, we can talk to BB!

375
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
No, I'm too depressed to talk.

376
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll give you $1,000 to talk to us.

377
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Hey, what do you think about making that beach trip an annual thing?

378
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
No!

379
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Alright, that's it, you guys. What happened out there?

380
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What? We took a walk, nothing happened.

381
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I came back with nothing all over me.

382
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Come on, what happened?

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
All right.

384
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
No, Joey, we swear we'd never tell.

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
They'll never understand.

386
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But we have to say something.

387
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
We have to get it out, it's eating me alive.

388
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Monica got stung by Joey fish.

389
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
All right.

390
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
All right.

391
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I got stung.

392
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Stung bad.

393
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I couldn't stand. I...

394
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I couldn't walk.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
We were two miles from the house.

396
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We were scared and alone.

397
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
We didn't think we could make it.

398
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I was in too much pain.

399
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
And I was tired from digging the huge hole.

400
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And then Joey remembered something.

401
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'd seen this thing on the Discovery Channel.

402
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wait a minute. I saw that on the Discovery Channel.

403
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, about jellyfish and how if...

404
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You...

405
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You peed on yourself?

406
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Ew!

407
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You can't say that. You don't know.

408
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I thought I was going to pass out from the pain.

409
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Anyway, I tried...

410
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
But I couldn't bend that way.

411
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So...

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Ew!

413
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
That's right, I stepped up.

414
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
She's my friend and she needed help.

415
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

416
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Only, uh... I couldn't.

417
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
I got the stage fright.

418
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I wanted to help, but there was just too much pressure.

419
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
So, uh... I turned to Chandler.

420
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Joey kept screaming at me.

421
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Do it now! Do it! Do it now!

422
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sometimes late at night, I can still hear this screaming.

423
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
That's because sometimes I just do it through my wall to freak you out.

424
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Time my shoes. So you go ahead, I'll catch up.

425
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Okay, okay.

426
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Come on! Let's go!

427
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You guys, I'm telling you, when she runs,

428
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
she looks like a cross between Kermit the Frog and the $6 billion man.

429
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Monica had such a crush on him.

430
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
She's the kisser's poster every night before she went to bed.

431
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I used to do that too!

432
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Did you also have his album? It's not easy being green.

433
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
So, Phoebe runs weird, huh?

434
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Yeah, yeah, you know what? And I know she's going to want to run again.

435
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I don't know how to get out of it. I mean, I live with her.

436
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Why don't you just be straight with her? Tell her the truth.

437
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
You're right. You're right. She'll just tell her the truth Гей!

438
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Hey, Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

439
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Monica, trip me! I don't think I can ever run again. Ever!

440
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Why would you do that? I don't know.

441
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Rachel, I'm sorry that I hurt your ankles.

442
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Uncle, we'll see.

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Oh, yeah, a lot. It's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out.

444
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
You lied so you could run by yourself.

445
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:14,000
No, no, Phoebe, no, I was, no, you know what? I was, I was actually just checking to see if I could run and I can't.

446
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Please, Rachel, I am not an idiot.

447
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
No, wait, Phoebe!

448
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Hey, Phoebe, can I talk to you for a second? Sure.

449
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Okay.

450
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Phoebe, look, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

451
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Okay, I handled the situation horribly and I should not have lied to you.

452
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
So, what should you have done?

453
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Well, I should have told you the truth.

454
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Uh-huh, which is.

455
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Well, you know, the reason that I didn't want to go running with you is because, um, well, you know, the way that you run is just a little...

456
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
So?

457
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.

458
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Why do you care? Because they're people.

459
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Like people that you don't know and will never see again.

460
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yes, but still they are people with eyes.

461
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to me.

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But, oh, okay.

463
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you.

464
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah. Okay. You're uptight.

465
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
What? I am not uptight.

466
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I am not uptight, man.

467
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's okay, Rachel. I'm not judging you. That's just who you are.

468
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Me, I'm more free. You know, I run like I did when I was a kid.

469
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Because it's the only way it's fun. You know?

470
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I mean, didn't you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off?

471
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
You know, like when you were running toward the swings or running away from Satan?

472
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The neighbor's dog.

473
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm so sorry. You're right. This feels great.

474
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
See? And you don't care if people are staring. It's just for a second.

475
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Because then you're gone.

476
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah. I feel so free and so graceful.

477
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Hey, we got for the horse.

478
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at the plaza.

479
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Oh, okay.

480
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Yeah.

481
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But I can't stay too long. I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
and I gotta look good, supposed to be playing a 19-year-old.

483
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
What?

484
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So when you said get up early, did you mean 1986?

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I guess I don't think I look 19.

486
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Oh, 19. We thought you said 90.

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Oh, okay.

488
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Okay, everybody, let's go. Let's go.

489
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

490
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So,

491
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
so,

492
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
so, dude, take whatever you want. Just please don't hurt me.

493
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,000
So I play a little PlayStation, huh? That's whack.

494
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,000
PlayStation is whack.

495
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Sup at the whack PlayStation Sup.

496
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Come on, am I 19 or what?

497
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Yes. On a scale from 1 to 10,

498
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
tending the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.

499
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Come on, man, really. How old?

500
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Young. You're a man, child.

501
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Okay, now go get changed because everybody's ready and please, oh, please, keep my underwear.

502
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, thanks.

503
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Now, I could pass for 19, right?

504
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Yes, you can pass for 19.

505
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Really? Yes. Seriously?

506
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Seriously? No. Okay?

507
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You can play your own age with just 31.

508
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm 30.

509
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Joey, you are not. You're 31.

510
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Oh, crap.

511
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Why, at the time, we're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square.

512
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It gets bigger and better and better.

513
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You know, kids?

514
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
And then the peacock bit me.

515
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Please kiss me at midnight.

516
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You see Sandy?

517
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom getting it on with Max, that's Scientist Geek.

518
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Cool, look at that. I didn't know how to tell you.

519
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Everybody of all is going,

520
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
the poly-thripping!

521
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,000
In 20 seconds, it'll be midnight.

522
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,000
And the moment of joy is upon us.

523
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Looks like that nose date pack thing worked out.

524
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.

525
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Not everybody's happy. Hey, Bobby!

526
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Why? Happy New Year!

527
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You know, I, uh, just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here.

528
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I don't know if you like kissing anyone.

529
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I can't kiss anyone.

530
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So I'm kissing everyone?

531
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I don't know. You can't kiss Ross, that's your brother.

532
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Perfect, perfect. So now everybody's going to kiss, but me.

533
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Alright, somebody kiss me.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me, it's midnight!

535
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Oh, yeah!

536
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Beeps. You know what I'm thinking?

537
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I don't know, okay.

538
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
How?

539
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
It's been so long since you've had sex. You're wondering if they've changed it.

540
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No. Although now that's what I'm thinking.

541
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Alright, so what were you thinking?

542
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Well, I was thinking that you gave the guy such great haircuts I thought maybe you'd like to do mine.

543
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Oh, no.

544
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Why not?

545
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Because I'm just incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak.

546
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
No, you're not?

547
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I know I'm not, but you are.

548
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I was trying to spare your feelings.

549
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
You know, it's funny, the last time Polo was here, my hand was so much shorter and cuter.

550
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Alright.

551
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Okay.

552
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
But, but, you have to promise that you will not be all like,

553
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
controlling and bossy and all, you know, monica about it.

554
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I promise.

555
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Alright, let's see.

556
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Now, some of you are going to get cut and some of you aren't.

557
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
But I promise none of you will feel a thing.

558
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Alright, that's it. I quit.

559
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
What? I didn't say anything.

560
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person.

561
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Okay? This is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person.

562
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm sorry. Sorry, Phoebe, it's just, well, just a little shorter than what we had discussed.

563
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Would you relax? I know what I am doing.

564
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
This is how he wears it.

565
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
How, who wears it?

566
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Demi Moore.

567
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Demi Moore is not a he.

568
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Well, he was a he in Arthur and in Den.

569
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,000
That's deadly Moore.

570
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.

571
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Oh. Oh.

572
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.

573
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh my god, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

574
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Which one is Demi Moore?

575
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,000
She's the actress. There was a disclosure in Decent Proposal Ghost.

576
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Oh, oh, she's got gorgeous hair.

577
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I know. Oh my god.

578
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
How is she?

579
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's too soon to tell.

580
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
She's resting, which is a good sign.

581
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
How's the hair?

582
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm not going to lie to you, Ross. It doesn't look good.

583
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling.

584
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Well, can we see you?

585
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Your hair looks too good. I think it would upset her.

586
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Ross, why don't you come on in?

587
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Hi.

588
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Hi.

589
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Hi.

590
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
So, which one do you like your boys as Chandler?

591
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
That's me.

592
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That's me.

593
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Joey Churriani. Big fan.

594
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
So, is that a bedroom?

595
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Yeah. Yeah, a bedroom there.

596
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
All right. Whenever you're ready.

597
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
That was weird.

598
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why would she go in the bedroom?

599
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm waiting.

600
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,000
So, she's a...

601
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Yep, that's one naked hooker.

602
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
So, tonight's the big bachelor party.

603
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah. Hey, thanks for giving me that girl's number.

604
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
No problem. Say who's the party for?

605
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,000
My husband.

606
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
You heard your husband a hooker?

607
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
She's a stripper.

608
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
No, she's a hooker.

609
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Is that what they call strippers sometimes?

610
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
When the hook is...

611
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Oh my god, dude! I can't believe you did this!

612
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Are you absolutely sure she's a hooker?

613
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
See, the bad is she's just the best, most expensive data I ever had.

614
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
All right. Maybe she's just asking to leave.

615
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Why me?

616
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Hey, it's your bachelor party.

617
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Which is why you should do it.

618
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I don't want to. You do it.

619
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
You do it. You do it.

620
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,000
All right. Rock paper scissors who has to tell the horror to leave.

621
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
What?

622
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I missed this.

623
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I don't think we've actually done this before.

624
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
No, I miss hanging out with you.

625
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Well, we still hang out?

626
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, not like we used to.

627
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Remember, you and me used to be inseparable.

628
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh, now it's like...

629
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Things are different.

630
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Well, you know, things are different.

631
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I'm married now.

632
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Yeah, sure. And hey, don't get me wrong.

633
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm so happy for you guys.

634
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
But I just... I miss hanging out just us, you know?

635
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Yeah, I miss that too.

636
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'll tell you what. For now, we'll make time to hang out with each other.

637
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
You got it. Come here.

638
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Oh, God. Listen, I am this close to robbing you guys.

639
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
She's a hooker! She's a hooker! She's a...

640
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Hi. We spoke on the phone?

641
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Well, nothing. Nothing.

642
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mustburger.

643
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Check it out.

644
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Giant's cowboys.

645
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
You're watching a football game in a funeral?

646
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,000
No, it's the pre-game. I'm going to watch it at the reception.

647
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,000
You are a frightening, frightening man.

648
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Oh, no! I know cowlo-shoes.

649
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Oh, I hope they're not ruined.

650
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
God, what a great day.

651
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
What? Weather wise.

652
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
I know. The air, the trees, even though Nana's gone there's...

653
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,000
There's something almost... I don't know, almost like...

654
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I'm fine. I'm fine.

655
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Just... I think my worst fear realized.

656
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
And done.

657
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, my God.

658
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I didn't feel the thing.

659
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Are you still looking for a job?

660
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Because you could twist circles around that sadistic bitch at the salon.

661
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Thanks. You want to see what it looks like?

662
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Hey! They totally matched. They look great.

664
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Look, great. How you doing?

665
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Yeah, yeah. I think it looks pretty good.

666
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
I was a little bit worried that I was uncovering a birthmark right about there,

667
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.

668
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Hey, Chandler. Thank you so much.

669
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
No problem.

670
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Listen, that's a pretty girly hour we just spent.

671
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
We should probably do something manly to make up for it.

672
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Yeah.

673
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Come on, I'll let you.

674
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Yeah.

675
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
We should pop your bill. We hope you enjoyed your stay.

676
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Oh, we did. And you still have all your lamps.

677
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
What? A factor in the room tax?

678
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, dude. Don't worry about it.

679
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I found an unattended maids card,

680
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,000
or way ahead of the game.

681
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, my God.

682
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
What?

683
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
There's something new in the bowl.

684
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Look, we have enough. Just walk away.

685
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
No, but I want the pinecones.

686
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
There's a forest right outside.

687
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
It's not the scene.

688
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Okay, go quick.

689
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Go, go, go!

690
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Thank you for a delightful stay.

691
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
My mate, Polkandy!

692
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,000
So, I just talked to one of the dual writers today.

693
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
And...

694
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,000
What is dual?

695
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Days of our lives.

696
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Anyway, you're not going to believe that my character is coming out of his coma.

697
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Oh, it's all right!

698
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
And, and not only that, I'm getting a new brain.

699
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,000
So, great things are happening at work and in your personal life.

700
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Wait, what do you mean you're getting a new brain?

701
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Well, they're killing off one of the characters on the show.

702
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,000
And when she dies, her brain is being transplanted into my body.

703
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What? A brain transplant?

704
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
It's ridiculous.

705
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Oh, I think it's ridiculous that you haven't had sex in three and a half months.

706
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,000
It's winter. There are fewer people on the street.

707
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Who are they killing off?

708
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Cecilia Monroe. She plays Jessica Lockhart.

709
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No!

710
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
She is so good at throwing drinks in people's faces.

711
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I mean, I don't think I've ever seen her finish a beverage.

712
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
And the way she slaps people all the time, who'd be loved to do that just once?

713
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm doing it.

714
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
And she's been on the show forever.

715
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.

716
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
Yeah, yeah. Help me out here.

717
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:24,000
When you come out of the brain transplant, you are going to be her?

718
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yes, but in Drake Ramore's body.

719
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Why is this so hard for you to get? I thought you were a scientist.

720
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Monica?

721
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
Actually, I think she went to the salon.

722
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Oh, yeah. Oh, she went to the salon, all right.

723
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Check it out.

724
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Who's date just got better?

725
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Chandler!

726
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Hey.

727
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What do you think?

728
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I think I can see your scalp.

729
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Don't you just love it?

730
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Yeah, yeah. You got shellfish in your head.

731
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
It's side something.

732
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
You go, girlfriend.

733
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
You never said that in your life, have you?

734
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Not once.

735
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Oh, listen to this.

736
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,000
What do you know? It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

737
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Oh, I can't wait for everyone to work to see these. Ow!

738
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

739
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
So if you want people to see them, then by definition,

740
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,000
you're not having them take it out. Say at the break of dawn?

741
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this.

742
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
You like that, right?

743
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Dancing, it dancing, it dancing, it dancing, it dancing, it dancing, it dancing!

744
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
What are you singing?

745
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
It's Valero from Ten.

746
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
It's right at the Valkyries from Apocalypse Now.

747
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,000
See, here's the thing. The cornrows are really a solution to your frizzy hair problem.

748
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
And now that we're home, you don't have that problem anymore.

749
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So if you think about it, I hate them.

750
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
What? You said you like them.

751
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Did I? Let's refresh.

752
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,000
I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.

753
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Come on, say you don't like them. Everybody else does.

754
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Again, let's journey back.

755
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never noticed the shape of your skull before.

756
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
And Joey, well, Joey didn't realize it was anything different.

757
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it.

758
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
You're just jealous because your hair can't do this.

759
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Get yourself in the tooth.

760
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
And the eye!

761
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Honey, you've been in there for a long time. Is everything okay?

762
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Not really.

763
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I have a problem.

764
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Really? What happened?

765
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Well, I was dancing around and singing No Woman No Cry.

766
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
I got stuck.

767
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You can't move at all.

768
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, well, I can move.

769
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the cornrows?

770
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,000
I guess so.

771
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Some of these look a little afraid.

772
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Yeah, I tried to know myself afraid.

773
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You got to pick a pocket or two.

774
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Boys, you've got to pick a pocket or...

775
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,000
...two.

776
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Lovely.

777
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Just lovely.

778
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Really? Thanks.

779
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Listen, Joey, we definitely want to see you for the call back on Saturday.

780
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
Excellent.

781
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,000
I'll be there.

782
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Okay. And listen, don't forget to bring your jazz shoes for the dance audition.

783
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
My, uh, my agent said that it wasn't a dancing part.

784
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Oh, Joey, all the roles got to dance a little.

785
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
But believe me, with your dance background, it'll be a piece of cake.

786
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Three years of modern dance with Twilitharp.

787
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Five years with the American Ballet Theatre.

788
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Hey, everybody lies on their resume, okay?

789
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I wasn't one of the Zoom kids either.

790
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
Can you, like, dance it all?

791
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Yeah, I can dance, you know.

792
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

793
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
What, what is that?

794
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Joey looks stupid now. There's no music playing.

795
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Uh, Joey?

796
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Joey, Triviani.

797
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Listen, Joey, I got a problem.

798
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I just got a call from my dance captain.

799
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,000
He's having a relationship crisis and can't get out of Long Island.

800
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
So does that mean the auditions are off?

801
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Listen, Joey, seeing as you've got the most experience,

802
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I want you to take these dances and teach them the combination.

803
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
What?

804
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh, Joey, come on, it's easy.

805
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:53,000
You know, it's hand, hand, head, head, up, out of the way, out of the way, big turn here.

806
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Round the jump, so soft, so soft, slide.

807
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Step, step, hands.

808
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It's a step-by-step in jazz hands.

809
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Have fun.

810
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Bye.

811
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
All right, let's do it.

812
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Oh, no, no, no.

813
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
What was that?

814
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I know, it's the best I could get out of it.

815
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Well, people, people, people, people, people.

816
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Let's try it again. And this time, let's everybody watch Joey.

817
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
So I'm how he's done.

818
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
I counted up, right?

819
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Did you say that there was an elevator in here?

820
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Yes, I did, but there isn't.

821
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Okay?

822
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You were kidding me.

823
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm not kidding.

824
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
I'm not kidding.

825
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
I'm not kidding.

826
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I'm not kidding.

827
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I'm not kidding.

828
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm not kidding.

829
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm not kidding.

830
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I'm not kidding.

831
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,000
I'm not kidding.

832
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Okay, here we go.

833
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay, don't left.

834
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Left.

835
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Left.

836
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
I know what?

837
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
There's no more left left.

838
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Okay, you know, lift it straight up over your head.

839
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Straight up over your head.

840
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,000
You can do it.

841
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,000
You can do it.

842
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh.

843
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Okay.

844
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:32,000
You got it?

845
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Yeah, go, go.

846
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Yeah, you got it, right?

847
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
You got it, right?

848
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,000
You got it, right?

849
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
You got it.

850
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh.

851
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Any chance you think the catch looks good there?

852
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Hey, Joe.

853
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What's up?

854
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Bad news.

855
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses,

856
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,000
and they weren't interested.

857
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh.

858
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Sorry, man.

859
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
But, uh, you watched the tape?

860
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Yeah, I liked it.

861
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,000
But, uh, my bosses didn't go for it.

862
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Stupid sons of bitches.

863
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You didn't watch the tape.

864
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
What?

865
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Of course I did.

866
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me.

867
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
I'm not lying to you.

868
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I watched it.

869
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Well, you lied again.

870
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I watched it.

871
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
Keep going, Pinocchio.

872
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I did.

873
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Now you didn't.

874
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
I'm telling you, I watched the tape.

875
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Did you watch the tape?

876
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
No.

877
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I can't believe Joey.

878
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
I hate being called a liar.

879
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
But you are a liar.

880
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
What did I just say?

881
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
You still here?

882
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt.

883
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I am insulted.

884
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
When I tell somebody I did something.

885
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Okay, well, let me just stop you right there.

886
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Okay, first, you lied.

887
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Right?

888
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Then, you lied about lying.

889
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Okay, so before you lie about lying about lying about lying about lying about lying about lying about lying.

890
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I was going to stop lying.

891
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?

892
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
You want to know why?

893
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Well, this is going well.

894
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape.

895
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Okay, if you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments.

896
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All right, now, remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan.

897
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
Ichiban!

898
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Ichiban, lipstick for man.

899
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Ichiban, lipstick for man.

900
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Psycho.

901
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape.

902
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
You really use a chameleon.
