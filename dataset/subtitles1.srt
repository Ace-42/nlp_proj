1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
I don't answer this question if you don't want to matter.

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,760
But I have...

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,400
I don't know why you brought this up, but I did hear you discuss...

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,400
that you had an extraordinary disagreement with your wife about yourself.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
Do you know what I'm talking about?

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,120
By myself, you mean...

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,080
Yes.

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,080
Oh.

9
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:19,839
Listen, I've...

10
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:21,039
Oh, this story. I do not know this...

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:21,920
Listen with interest.

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,839
Well...

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:26,800
One night, as you do, we were talking about stuff.

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,480
I don't...

15
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:30,240
And I just had no interest in...

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,079
and of course, being circumcised, I said...

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,240
They were chatting. They're married.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,439
They're married. They're allowed.

19
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,640
And she said...

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,079
She said...

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,079
You're not circumcised?

22
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:46,400
I said, what do you mean?

23
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,320
You've only known me a few...

24
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,880
All my life, I remember my mother telling me why,

25
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,799
because it was fashionable at the time.

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:54,480
She said, you're not circumcised.

27
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,000
I said, that's ridiculous.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,400
I should know if I'm circumcised.

29
00:00:58,799 --> 00:00:59,920
Of course I am.

30
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,439
End of conversation.

31
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:04,879
But the next day, I happened to be seeing my doctor...

32
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:08,560
Are you okay?

33
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,879
I was seeing my doctor for my annual physical, of course.

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:15,840
So...

35
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,840
Well, he was down there.

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,799
I said, it's getting dark, by the way,

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,000
of...

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,960
Um...

39
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,960
That my wife and I had a little disagreement.

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,239
Um...

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,959
I am circumcised, I'm not, because she says I'm not.

42
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,639
And he goes...

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,799
Not...

44
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,919
He said, no, no, no, it's not possible.

45
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:50,799
So he looked down again and he said, hey, I'm Jewish.

46
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,919
I know the difference.

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:54,400
That is a bizarre story.

48
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,600
That is...

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,799
That is a bizarre story.

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,000
You're not Jewish.

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,599
That is a bizarre story.

52
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,799
Oh, God.

53
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,799
Oh, God.

54
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
I have grandchildren.

55
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
You're gonna have to change your Facebook status, no?

56
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,479
Yes.

57
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,759
No more beef stew.

58
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,759
Well, there's more beef stew.

59
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,399
Oh!

60
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,599
Oh.

61
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:27,759
You born in a way?

62
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:28,799
I was born in Hawaii.

63
00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:29,759
You lived there.

64
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,000
It's a school, but I did a lot of my growing up there.

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,199
So, yeah, so it was a...

66
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,799
I don't know. I don't think, no.

67
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:36,000
I did.

68
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
No, I told you.

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,039
I told you.

70
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,799
I told you for years, I've always said I was...

71
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:43,039
But when we were there, you gave me a big speech like,

72
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,039
this is my land, I started.

73
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,839
I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought,

74
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:49,839
I thought, I thought, I thought, I thought, yeah.

75
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:51,119
I'm sure that was that.

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
Now, I'm a sudden stand-fran.

77
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I was stand-fran, then I transferred.

78
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,360
When we were there, you gave me a very...

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
Like, spiritual speech about how it all started.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
I get my...

81
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,400
I held you over, it's clear.

82
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I didn't think so, man.

83
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,599
It's clear, it's clear.

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
This is a clip where I was born and my mother didn't mean it.

85
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:12,480
This is the problem.

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,439
Yes.

87
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:15,360
You're trying to be respectful.

88
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,480
Hawaii was beautiful.

89
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,680
Beautiful.

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,240
You know, mountainside and lushness

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,280
and we shot in this beautiful place called Kuloh Ranch

92
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,760
where a drastic park, the original dress park

93
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,000
was shot and the ones after that as well.

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,760
And it was just amazing.

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,719
But you didn't like it, Kevin?

96
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:31,360
He hated it.

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
No, this is the problem.

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
I didn't like it at all.

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,000
I mean, outside of the spiritual grounds

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,439
that you took me to, and I swore,

101
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,719
you even sung a song.

102
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,760
You were like...

103
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,439
Yeah, I'm not just saying that.

104
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,240
I remember.

105
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
I said, we'll talk about it later.

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
We'll talk about it later.

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,240
This song, you were like,

108
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,960
you were like,

109
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,560
Kuloh Matana.

110
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,760
That's how the thing was.

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,719
The original.

112
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,960
So, did you bring your medals with you?

113
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,760
No.

114
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,240
We did.

115
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,439
All of them might be wearing them.

116
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,439
Oh, no, they're just casually in the back pockets.

117
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,400
Do they go up there?

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
No, these are proper, proper, a little bit medals.

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,640
Wow.

120
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,879
Married if you've seen an Olympic medal.

121
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,879
I actually did.

122
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,120
It was a French people's victory.

123
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Or was it a French people's victory?

124
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,800
Oh, the French got gold.

125
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,319
Oh, I'm going to go.

126
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm going to have to go.

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Toad, I'm going to go.

128
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
Is there anyone in Ireland who hasn't seen those medals?

129
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,920
They look like they've been around the block, those medals.

130
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah.

131
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,399
They're fairly casual, yeah.

132
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,879
And of course, Michael, down in Kulohani,

133
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:34,800
word must have reached you off the Adoniver.

134
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,360
Oh, for sure.

135
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,959
I mean, I wasn't in Kulohani at the time,

136
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,120
but everybody knew about it.

137
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
That's for sure, yeah.

138
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,319
And Marion, watching that clip

139
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,639
and that could you understand the accents?

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,399
Nothing, not a word.

141
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:49,519
I understood since.

142
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,319
Oh.

143
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,120
That's what I was saying.

144
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,199
I was like, I want to move myself with Michael.

145
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,560
It is take carry accent.

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,560
LAUGHTER

147
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,560
So, listen.

148
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,519
It is.

149
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,519
Because people love the interviews you did during the Olympics.

150
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,279
But you guys knew you were being funny while you were doing the interviews.

151
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,079
I don't know.

152
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
No, I think it was funny because it would be in themselves.

153
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,560
Yeah.

154
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Well, to be fair, we weren't trying to do interviews.

155
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,240
We weren't trying to do interviews, like, but...

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,240
You just...

157
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
It's trying to happen now, we're like...

158
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,079
You did seem very happy to be in Rio.

159
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,079
Oh, it's quite serious about the whole situation,

160
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,079
all right? Every time we talk, it's the truth, like.

161
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,279
Yeah.

162
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,959
LAUGHTER

163
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:35,519
And then I don't understand, like, people ask us these questions

164
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:37,519
all the time after races that just so happened,

165
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,519
they put a camera in front of us in Rio.

166
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:40,879
I don't know.

167
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,759
You want to silver medals, or something, everyone will be there.

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,839
But the great thing is, Ireland doesn't ever want any medal in rowing before.

169
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:48,879
Have they?

170
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:49,920
No, it's all in the Olympics.

171
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,439
No, they have a few World Championship titles.

172
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:53,519
All right, but it's the first Olympic medal, yeah.

173
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,519
Woo-hoo!

174
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,519
APPLAUSE

175
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,519
Very good.

176
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,159
And the interview where you talked about your approach to the race.

177
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:08,800
The phrase that you used in that, so explain to the people what you said in that.

178
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,159
Do you know what I'm going to say?

179
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:11,759
About going A to B fast, you can.

180
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,759
Yeah.

181
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:14,680
It's a fairly simple sport, like.

182
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,680
LAUGHTER

183
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,920
Does it start like a finish line?

184
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,399
You're going to complicate it, you're going to complicate it.

185
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:23,319
People do complicate it, like.

186
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,399
Your men says go out to start and there's a hooter at the finish, and you go to the...

187
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,920
Go out to the hooter, and...

188
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Go what you should like.

189
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,639
LAUGHTER

190
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,800
Traveling, this is based on your life.

191
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,000
I mean, this is things...

192
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Yeah.

193
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I mean...

194
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,519
LAUGHTER

195
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,039
Looosely, Crayham.

196
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,640
No, but things like, isn't the washing machine that happened to you?

197
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,640
What?

198
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,160
The washing.

199
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,480
You were very hungover.

200
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,240
Oh.

201
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Yeah.

202
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,439
LAUGHTER

203
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:53,879
No, tell Tony Foster, that story.

204
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:54,879
LAUGHTER

205
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,040
All that stories are really cool, though, Grail.

206
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:04,040
When I was teaching, which is what this show is based on, I went home one weekend,

207
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,520
and I was in my 30s.

208
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,600
I was probably 33 years of age.

209
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,520
I went home to see my mother, and then I went back.

210
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
And while I was at home, my mother did my washing for me, because I was only 33.

211
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,640
LAUGHTER

212
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
And I went back.

213
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:24,439
And on the Sunday night, I got really drunk, and then I went for a curry.

214
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:26,439
And then the next day I went into school.

215
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,439
LAUGHTER

216
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:30,439
I'm going to.

217
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,160
I went into school, and it was a school in Slau, and it was quite a rough school,

218
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,320
but they had a really brilliant hearing impaired department, so they were hearing impaired kids who,

219
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,320
you know, struggled.

220
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,400
They were really looked after in the school.

221
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
Anyway, I was really hungover.

222
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,360
I went there, and at that break time, I felt really uncomfortable.

223
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,000
I thought something's not right, you know?

224
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
So I went to the toilet, and I pulled my trousers down, and some of my mother's knickers had got...

225
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
LAUGHTER

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
..I got mixed up in the wash, you know.

227
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,240
And I was wearing my mother's underwear.

228
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,040
LAUGHTER

229
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,360
And I went, oh, god, no!

230
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,360
Oh, I remember going, oh, you loser.

231
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,080
This is such a low point, you fucking loser.

232
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,080
LAUGHTER

233
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,400
And then...

234
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
LAUGHTER

235
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,400
And then...

236
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,920
The curry and the booze...

237
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,720
The curry and the booze kicked in from the night before.

238
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,520
LAUGHTER

239
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
So I...

240
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,120
I did like a fecal Jackson Pollock.

241
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,720
LAUGHTER

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
APPLAUSE

243
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
And I started...

244
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
APPLAUSE

245
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
I started going, oh, god, not this!

246
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,360
Not this as well!

247
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,759
Oh, Jesus!

248
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,920
So I cleaned myself up, and I pulled my mother's pants back there.

249
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,440
And I went back into the classroom,

250
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,320
and I saw one of the hearing impaired kids just looking at me like this.

251
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,399
And that's when I remembered that I had a microphone directly.

252
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,920
LAUGHTER

253
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
LAUGHTER

254
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,399
I can't see.

255
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,920
LAUGHTER

256
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,399
There you go.

257
00:08:58,399 --> 00:08:59,399
Here we go.

258
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,399
LAUGHTER

259
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,920
LAUGHTER

260
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,279
A lot of youngsters, they, you know, they revere you, so they look to you.

261
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,000
But the other thing you inspire is impressions, people doing impressions.

262
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now, when people do impressions of you, is it like sort of nails on a chalkboard

263
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,360
or do you kind of enjoy it?

264
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,599
No, I kind of enjoy it, especially if they do it well.

265
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,599
LAUGHTER

266
00:09:20,599 --> 00:09:23,599
So, no, it's great.

267
00:09:23,599 --> 00:09:24,399
LAUGHTER

268
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,399
I love it.

269
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,399
I only ask!

270
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
LAUGHTER

271
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,399
No, because...

272
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:32,399
Because any hiddlestoners watching will know.

273
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:34,600
Tom Hiddleston does impressions.

274
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,600
You do a lot of impressions, so who is in your canon?

275
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,240
It's an expression of admiration, just to be clear.

276
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,319
So I do impressions of people that I admire, and I sort of listen to them.

277
00:09:46,319 --> 00:09:50,439
I get the first time I did an impression that anyone was aware of.

278
00:09:50,439 --> 00:09:54,240
I was just telling a story about Midnight in Paris, the Woody Allen film I was in.

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
And how I never had the whole script, and I thought it was set in the 20s.

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,840
And I turned up and I bumped into Owen Wilson.

281
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,680
He didn't look like he was in the 20s at all.

282
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,600
And I said to him, I said,

283
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,040
so wait, how on, who are you playing?

284
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,480
Because I'm playing F-Scope Fitzgerald, and I know Corey Stolz playing on his hamming way,

285
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,560
and we're all playing figures of history, and he went,

286
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,200
oh, no, no, no, no.

287
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,440
I'm from now. I go back in Paris.

288
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,440
There's a time machine, you know?

289
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,759
It's kind of cool, and it's kind of wooding,

290
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:25,280
and you just kind of... it's kind of awesome.

291
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,320
LAUGHTER

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,320
Great job!

293
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

294
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,560
I've done... I've done... I mean...

295
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,840
I've done... I've been made to the impressors of my fellow Avengers.

296
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,240
I think everyone does an impression of Christopher Walken,

297
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,920
because he's such an easy kind of...

298
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:47,960
You know, I feel like what this show needs is more cowbell...

299
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,800
depends on what you like me to say.

300
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,240
Basically, there's no punctuation.

301
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:04,080
And anything that comes out of my mouth...

302
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,240
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,279
And I go...

304
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,240
APPLAUSE

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,600
I know whole pages of heat.

306
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,759
You surprised me.

307
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:15,759
LAUGHTER

308
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,200
So, there's a scene in the middle of the film, which you'll be familiar with.

309
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,080
You were there.

310
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
LAUGHTER

311
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,080
The one person you don't need to explain is you.

312
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
So, look, there's...

313
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
LAUGHTER

314
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:30,759
He remembers.

315
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,759
You're very good in this film.

316
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,960
Did you see it in the middle of the film, which is...

317
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,159
Because Al Pacino and Robert are in the middle.

318
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,159
LAUGHTER

319
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,159
Sorry about that.

320
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:43,560
They're separated, like a great thriller.

321
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,799
They're separated from... for the entire film, and they meet twice

322
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:48,519
once at the end of once in the middle.

323
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,080
And it takes place at a restaurant, L.A.

324
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,879
It's a great scene. It's one of the great pieces of screen acting.

325
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,639
You can hope to watch. There it is. It's a picture of it.

326
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:59,360
It's like a... It's a mutual recognition of each other.

327
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,840
Anyway, so there's a bit where they...

328
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,080
They sit and have coffee and have tea and talk about stuff.

329
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,159
I'm going on, I apologize.

330
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:07,319
Anyway, so Al Pacino, at one point...

331
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,559
Al Pacino says this. He goes...

332
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,559
So...

333
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,559
LAUGHTER

334
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,039
We're sitting here, like a couple of regular fellas.

335
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:22,039
I mean...

336
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:24,120
You do what you do.

337
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,759
I do what I got to do...

338
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,240
If I'm there...

339
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,799
And I got to put you away.

340
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:34,679
I won't like it.

341
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:38,919
But if it's between you and some poor bastard

342
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:42,200
who his wife is going to turn into a widow,

343
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,960
brother, you are going down.

344
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,960
LAUGHTER

345
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,639
And then...

346
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,639
And then...

347
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,639
And then...

348
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,480
And then Michael Mancott's back to the esteemed gentleman

349
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,680
at the end of the sofa.

350
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,440
LAUGHTER

351
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,680
What if you do got me boxed in?

352
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm not going to put you down.

353
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,840
I'm even face to face.

354
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,440
Yeah.

355
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,080
But I will not hesitate.

356
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,200
Not for a second.

357
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,720
That's my...

358
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,279
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

359
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,080
This is so...

360
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,920
This is so meta.

361
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,519
I feel like I've gone into a parallel universe where...

362
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,480
You were playing Gullisport. Yes, I played that.

363
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
No, that's great.

364
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,040
I do that present of Ken Brown.

365
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,200
That's my favourite scene. Was he your favourite scene?

366
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Yeah. It's a good...

367
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
LAUGHTER

368
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,800
No, no, but my favourite scene that was written before,

369
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:49,799
not because of...

370
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:53,279
I'm doing it, but I'm just my favourite scene written and the film.

371
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,519
You know, that's...

372
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,039
It's a great piece of writing.

373
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:58,479
It feels like it plays in two singles, in a way.

374
00:13:58,479 --> 00:13:59,479
Like, just...

375
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:00,479
Yeah.

376
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:02,719
And it's like the most beautiful game of tennis.

377
00:14:02,719 --> 00:14:04,240
Did you do lots of takes?

378
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,439
Did you do lots of takes?

379
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:06,439
I forget how many takes we did.

380
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:08,839
I don't think we did more than...

381
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,719
5 to 8 or 9 at the moment.

382
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:13,240
Maybe, maybe, or less.

383
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,479
You talk about your dreams and your life.

384
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,479
LAUGHTER

385
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,840
It's so great. It's so great.

386
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,360
There's another bit where you go.

387
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
LAUGHTER

388
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,840
You say, he says...

389
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,360
He says, Puccino says,

390
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,399
So you never wanted a regular type of life.

391
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:31,159
And...

392
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,440
Bob, may I call you Bob?

393
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,240
Yeah.

394
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,960
Bob says, what's that?

395
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,720
Bob accused of ball games?

396
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Yeah.

397
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,920
LAUGHTER

398
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,919
APPLAUSE

399
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:47,479
And then, Kylia, obviously your mother loves you

400
00:14:47,479 --> 00:14:49,159
because you heard her daughter.

401
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:50,159
Yeah.

402
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:52,399
But she is actually a fan as well.

403
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,919
You know, we don't quite know.

404
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:54,919
It's...

405
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,639
I know she is...

406
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,839
Oh, goodness, right.

407
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,120
So, my...

408
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,479
One day my mum came to set on the Star Wars set.

409
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:07,199
And I was getting this thing called Cyber-Scanned,

410
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,159
which is where you stand in this kind of loads of cameras

411
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:13,279
and they kind of take your form

412
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,279
and put you into a computer and make a toy

413
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,159
or some sort of merchandise or your face on a cushion.

414
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,159
LAUGHTER

415
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:23,319
And so...

416
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:25,319
I go off and do this and I come back and mums

417
00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:26,519
like I've made a great friend.

418
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,719
I'm really in this lovely, excellent.

419
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,639
And she likes the merchandise, you know,

420
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,839
director of all of Star Wars or something.

421
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:35,360
And I'm like, well, I'll say, you're very impressive.

422
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,759
And then, before I know it, what comes in the post,

423
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,759
he's loads of cushions.

424
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:41,759
LAUGHTER

425
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,279
My face on it.

426
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,799
So...

427
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,799
My own mum, I guess, she gets a seared a fair amount, you know.

428
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:49,960
But apparently, it's not enough, so...

429
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,480
LAUGHTER

430
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,080
I was kind of blown away at how much merchandise there is.

431
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,399
Yes, it's all...

432
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,840
And it's just the beginning.

433
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,200
It was like the pre-murchin' dyes.

434
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,120
Not even the real stuff is out yet.

435
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,759
And my mum has all of it.

436
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:04,600
And it doesn't have that the doll yet, so...

437
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,919
Look, this is so weird.

438
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,319
Is this in your flat or her house?

439
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Yes, for sure.

440
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,879
Okay, so basically, she'll be really funny

441
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:13,160
if I came home and it was everywhere in my...

442
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,800
OK, so this is...

443
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
This is...

444
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,560
Is this Amelia's actual bedroom?

445
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Well...

446
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
LAUGHTER

447
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,560
I love you, girl!

448
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,560
I was like a joke, and then...

449
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,560
And then...

450
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,560
Oh, and then...

451
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Oh, my goodness.

452
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,400
We found the photo, but it's not like that now.

453
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,400
That's what I'm saying.

454
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,400
There was another reason why I'm saying...

455
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
You took a first date back to that.

456
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,400
Yeah.

457
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,399
Come on in.

458
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,399
I just think this little thing won't it?

459
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,399
I don't have a CV.

460
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,399
I just have a bedroom.

461
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
But this is cool, though.

462
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,399
So your mother, a big fan, but...

463
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,399
Yeah.

464
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,399
Brad Pitt, also a great big fan.

465
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:54,399
That was the best night of my life.

466
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,399
Yes.

467
00:16:55,399 --> 00:16:57,399
I'm happy.

468
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,399
Tell the story quickly.

469
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,399
Tell the story quickly.

470
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:03,399
We've got a feeling of doing...

471
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:04,400
Yeah, there's a duvet.

472
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
We're only here.

473
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
She's...

474
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm not a slipper.

475
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
No, yeah.

476
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,400
It was this auction thing that happened, and I...

477
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
They called me and said, do you want to...

478
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Do you want to auction something off, like maybe sort of an experience

479
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
watching the show with you or something?

480
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
And I was like, OK, it's lovely.

481
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
It's great for charity.

482
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
Yeah.

483
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
It'll be for some...

484
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You know, something.

485
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,400
Yeah.

486
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,400
And it'll be fine.

487
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Anyway, so I get there.

488
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,400
It's a good thing.

489
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
It'll be a good thing.

490
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
I get there, and it's basically like this...

491
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,400
It's the Oscars.

492
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,400
There's so many celebrities in this room,

493
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
and suddenly remember that I said that I would auction something off,

494
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
and so the fear grows.

495
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
So I was petrified, absolute petrified.

496
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
And then the person who's a table I was on is a friend,

497
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
and he was being very kind and kind of put the paddle up,

498
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
and I was like, thanks very much.

499
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
That's very sweet.

500
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
That'll be that.

501
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,400
And then someone else's paddle up, went up across the other side of the room,

502
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
and I didn't really know, and then suddenly it was sort of becoming a bit of money,

503
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
and I was kind of thinking, oh, this is absolutely mental,

504
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
and someone went, it's Brad Pitt, and I was like, oh...

505
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
I'm like, you're free.

506
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,400
Yeah, exactly.

507
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,400
And I look over to the room, and he's got his paddle up.

508
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Brad's paddle.

509
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,400
Brad's paddle.

510
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Oh, did he experience?

511
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,400
No, not quite.

512
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Well, it didn't work out, because the person who's friend who's my friend,

513
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I think it was probably all set up.

514
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
The person who was my friend ended up doing the highest bid.

515
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
Boo!

516
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
My friend.

517
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,400
But yeah, I just kind of looked over with just the most insane,

518
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,400
emoji heart eyes being like, this is just the greatest moment of my life.
