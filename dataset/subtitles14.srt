1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
And is it true that you are mistaken for Daniel Radcliffe?

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,280
It happens a lot.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,439
And he's mistaken for me and apparently signs my name.

4
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:11,800
Because cheeky.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,800
Yeah, apparently.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
It's a Jew the time.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
You're busy.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,879
I was in an elevator once.

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,960
This was many years ago.

10
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,800
But I was in an elevator.

11
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,320
And you know that thing when you're in an elevator

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,640
with one other person and there's that kind of awkward silence.

13
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,120
And you're both kind of looking busy doing not like

14
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,800
at the buttons and at the phone.

15
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,240
And so there was that.

16
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,520
And I could tell that this by this guy's energy

17
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,719
that he wanted to say something.

18
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,840
He was working it up, working it up, working it up.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,439
And then all of a sudden he burst out and said, Harry Potter.

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,520
And I was like, no.

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,799
So funny.

22
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,359
Well, let's see how it could happen.

23
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,079
Let's put a look at some examples.

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,320
There you are.

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,079
Now, it's a turdful face.

26
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,880
Smile.

27
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:00,119
It's not, you know what I mean?

28
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,839
I do sort of see it.

29
00:01:01,839 --> 00:01:02,839
Let's try another one.

30
00:01:02,839 --> 00:01:04,439
I'll try another one.

31
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,039
OK, turn to the side.

32
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:08,799
That's not so good.

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:09,840
Let's see one more.

34
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,079
How do I?

35
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,079
How about Kim?

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,079
I'm kidding.

37
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:23,079
That's great.

38
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,359
You're both in your own ways.

39
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:26,120
Sort of sex symbols.

40
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,920
There are...

41
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Well, you are.

42
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,280
Don't laugh at that.

43
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I think I'm...

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,879
Encourage the guests.

45
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:34,039
Oh, no.

46
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:35,039
Oh, no.

47
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:36,039
Oh, no.

48
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,039
You're sex symbols.

49
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:38,039
Oh, no.

50
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:42,239
Don't, yes.

51
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:44,239
This lady's dead with a moon.

52
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,759
It's true.

53
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,400
You get the attention of the ladies.

54
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,239
Yes.

55
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:50,719
You get...

56
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,719
They don't want to shag me, though.

57
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:53,479
They want to...

58
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,959
They write to me and say, oh, you seem nice.

59
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:59,439
Would you like to come to the Gilderming area for a pint?

60
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,439
LAUGHTER

61
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,000
That's quite a lot right there, isn't it, of...

62
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ordnance.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,199
It's quite enough.

64
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:10,359
When I did a play here, a long time ago, almost 20 years ago,

65
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,240
in 1990, called Burnness.

66
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
I saw that.

67
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,079
And I kept...

68
00:02:15,079 --> 00:02:18,439
I had... I don't anymore.

69
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:25,359
But I had a whole collection of the letters I received.

70
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,600
Many of which had accompanying photos.

71
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:37,640
And many of the photos were sort of along the order of either...

72
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:46,520
This is me on my beach vacation last year in Croatia

73
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,400
on the Dalmatian coast that happened to be a nude beach.

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,480
LAUGHTER

75
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,800
This is what I don't get.

76
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,800
This is me with my puppy.

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,760
LAUGHTER

78
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
No, I'll just crack one off now, then.

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
LAUGHTER

80
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,960
So, if it wasn't that sort of photograph, what sort of photograph would it be?

81
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,000
A full close-up of it.

82
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
LAUGHTER

83
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
Well, a few dendor or the puppy.

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
No.

85
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,960
The Croatian coast slide.

86
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,480
This isn't me, though.

87
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,959
The Croatian coast slide.

88
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:25,439
This isn't me.

89
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,439
Oh, no.

90
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,679
That in an envelope from Mr Mac.

91
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:29,839
LAUGHTER

92
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:30,839
This is very good.

93
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:32,359
He's like this.

94
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:34,239
LAUGHTER

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,239
OK.

96
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,239
Yeah.

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,079
We'll go to the comments and then 15 copies were all my favourite.

98
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:41,079
LAUGHTER

99
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,719
Well, just a little bit more again.

100
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,159
Yeah, a little bit more.

101
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,159
To get replies without a bat.

102
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,159
LAUGHTER

103
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,159
Oh, I've licked it better this time.

104
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
LAUGHTER

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,159
This is a beautiful job.

106
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,159
LAUGHTER

107
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:59,159
That's a beautiful job, yeah.

108
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,159
LAUGHTER

109
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:04,159
That's beautiful, darling. That's beautiful.

110
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,159
LAUGHTER

111
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,159
I wasn't even one of those first snow moves at this stage.

112
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,159
LAUGHTER

113
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,159
No, no.

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,159
I want you to do one of the curtains.

115
00:04:16,159 --> 00:04:18,159
No curtains.

116
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
I'm not going to look back.

117
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
I mean, he were here now.

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
LAUGHTER

119
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
And, you know, you just...

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,160
What do you say back to them?

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,160
LAUGHTER

122
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
In a way you say,

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,160
thank you, it's lovely, that's very, very kind, it's fascinating.

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
But I'm more anal.

125
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
LAUGHTER

126
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,160
You know, people thought you'd about the lever...

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
You're either a potter or a lever.

128
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,160
You're either somebody.

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,160
If you're asked where your keys are, you'll say they're where I put them,

130
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
in which case you're a good human.

131
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Or you'll say they're where I left them, in which case you will die of dysentery.

132
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
LAUGHTER

133
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,160
In relationships, you always get one with the other, you always get a potter with a lever,

134
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,160
because two potters will kill each other.

135
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
LAUGHTER

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,160
And two levers.

137
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,160
And it's justified, you know, because I've always been the potter.

138
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,160
So I've always been the one going, no, that goes there and that's please, love me.

139
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,160
LAUGHTER

140
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,160
LAUGHTER

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,160
LAUGHTER

142
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,160
It is interesting this thing about quirky rules for living,

143
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,160
because we've tried it with all these four, because we thought, oh, this'll be funny.

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,160
And so, when people laugh at you for your rules,

145
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,160
or did they kind of go, yes, you're so right, we do need rules for living.

146
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,160
Yeah, no, it's a bit of, but I make sure that everyone I talk about,

147
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,160
people will at least see the logic behind.

148
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,160
I don't want to be the nutter on stage, she's going,

149
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,160
I can only eat blue ones.

150
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,160
LAUGHTER

151
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,160
So I like to feel people, not everyone had your attitude,

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,160
couldn't everyone have something, even if you don't know.

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
If you, you'll be at someone's house on the toilet,

154
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,160
and you will turn their toilet roll round, without even knowing you've done it.

155
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,160
And everyone's got a little, yeah, you see your old brother in the kitchen.

156
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
What's your, do you have a quirky habit?

157
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Do you have a rule, do you have a quirky habit?

158
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Like a habit?

159
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Yeah.

160
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,160
I used to have some crazy pre-performance, like quirks,

161
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
that I've decided to get rid of all of those,

162
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,160
because on the personality type, if I decided I'm going to start needing things

163
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,160
before I go on stage, it's just going to escalate to the point of being completely intolerable.

164
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,160
But in the first two or three years of my career,

165
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,160
I decided in my own crazy mind that I couldn't go on stage,

166
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,160
unless I had some kind of, like, patterned or colored socks and underwear.

167
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
I know, crazy.

168
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
But I could not have white underwear or socks.

169
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,160
If I go out on stage in white socks and underwear,

170
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
it's going to be the worst show I've ever had in my life.

171
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
So I would actively find, like, polka dot underwear,

172
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
that's where I'm stage, yeah.

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,160
So already I'm thinking, you're right, white socks are wrong.

174
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
That's right.

175
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,160
White underwear is so good, but white socks are wrong.

176
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,160
Plus a white underwear in a situation of high stress is also...

177
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Maybe that's subconsciously, that's what I was thinking.

178
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Catherine, what do you...

179
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Yeah, no, the thing I still do,

180
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
but I think it's related to superstition.

181
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
You know that thing they say you should never cross on the stairs.

182
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Well, I do cross people on the stairs,

183
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,160
but I always say in my mind when I cross someone on the stairs

184
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,160
or they cross me on the stairs,

185
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I wish you luck.

186
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,160
No, no, what is it? Oh, shit, oh, god!

187
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
No, here it is.

188
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
When someone cross me on the stairs, I go,

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
you give me luck, I bring you luck.

190
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,160
And that's what I say in my head.

191
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I don't wish!

192
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
I do it and I can't not say it.

193
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
I can't not say it in my head.

194
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,160
David, you crazy?

195
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Do you know something?

196
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Something that I'm aware, I've conquered one.

197
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
I used to spend a lot of time...

198
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,160
If you...

199
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,160
Blooks tend to have lots of black socks, right?

200
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,160
And I had to get the right black sock with the right black sock.

201
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,160
And I would spend hours with socks green.

202
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Yes, we got this little bit of ribbing on that.

203
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Is that the same ribbing?

204
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
That's not quite the...

205
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
But look, great, look, look.

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
This has changed my life.

207
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Oh, no, no, no, what?

208
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,160
This has changed my life.

209
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm so excited that I can't get my...

210
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Look, this will change my life.

211
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
With the hidden pattern.

212
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,160
Oh!

213
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,160
I must do this.

214
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,159
So you can tell...

215
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:40,159
I'm super-mysecreted in your shoe.

216
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Is the answer to all your...

217
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,159
And these ones will be better, because these ones...

218
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,159
Tell you what day to wear them on!

219
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,159
Yes!

220
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,159
A genius.

221
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,159
You've changed my life.

222
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:54,159
You're not fit for your husband.

223
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:55,159
But really about you.

224
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,159
You kind of think, oh, growing up in California must be lovely.

225
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,159
But your school was quite rough.

226
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,159
Yes, my school was...

227
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,159
I grew up in pretty much like ghetto.

228
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,159
I know it's the blonde hair blue eyes that...

229
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:06,159
That tricks you, but then you hear me talk.

230
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,159
And then you go, what is...

231
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,159
What's wrong with this person?

232
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:12,159
Don't you get into proper fights?

233
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,159
Yeah, well, you had to be a skinny white girl.

234
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,159
I mean, that's...

235
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,159
You have to be able to defend yourself.

236
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:19,159
Yeah, right?

237
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:20,159
Yeah.

238
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,159
Do you have a hood name?

239
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,159
I did.

240
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,159
I can't...

241
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,159
I can't get a...

242
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:25,159
I'm blind.

243
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,159
I was always back in.

244
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,159
You want to show them what you're packing today?

245
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,159
No, I tapped it.

246
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,159
Oh, you mean this?

247
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,159
Yeah, you're telling me.

248
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,159
She's trying to use something else.

249
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,159
We have a...

250
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:44,159
I tapped it.

251
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,159
I tapped it.

252
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:47,159
What are you trying to tell us?

253
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,159
We have plenty of things on.

254
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
I know.

255
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,159
Clearly, I will say anything for a while.

256
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:57,159
I got the costume on, so...

257
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,159
Yeah, I do.

258
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,159
She says it's just packing.

259
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,159
We met lift loss.

260
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,159
Now, we're talking about your...

261
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,159
Going to school.

262
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:06,159
Because your parents weren't very strict.

263
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:08,159
And your granny...

264
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,159
Your granny was like a bear group.

265
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:13,159
My granny would have put you to shame.

266
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,159
I'm telling you about your granny.

267
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:16,159
Okay, my granny was like...

268
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,159
She lived off the land.

269
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:21,159
I mean, literally, she raised everything that she ate.

270
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,159
And...

271
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:24,159
And made all her own clothes and everything.

272
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,159
And during the summer, she would go to Arizona.

273
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,159
Where she lived in the valley in California.

274
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,159
That was...

275
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:32,159
It was about 100 degrees in the summer.

276
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,159
But it was too cold for her.

277
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:36,159
So she had to go to Arizona where it's 120 degrees during the summer.

278
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,159
And she would walk around with just like her skirt on.

279
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:42,159
And a pair of sandals.

280
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:43,159
Topless.

281
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,159
And now this is a woman who has six children, okay?

282
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:47,159
They were like...

283
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,159
They were down here.

284
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:49,159
Yeah, they were...

285
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:51,159
The bad teacher would not have worn them on.

286
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,159
They were like, kind of below the waistband probably.

287
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,159
Or they go off.

288
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:56,159
That's what the Florida tent is.

289
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,159
Where you could just like flip them over the shoulder for the baby over that.

290
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,159
Well...

291
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,159
That's what they do in Africa, right?

292
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:05,159
They do.

293
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,159
That's why boobies are supposed to sag,

294
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:09,159
so that you can put them over the shoulder, wrap it under.

295
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:13,159
So the babies on the back can eat suckle and you don't have to stop working.

296
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:15,159
Yeah, a little lessen, right?

297
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,159
I'm all done.

298
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,159
There we go.

299
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,159
So this is...

300
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,159
Is your granny did that?

301
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,159
So my...

302
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:22,159
I don't know if she ever actually did that.

303
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,159
It's a good one.

304
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:29,159
But she would go hunting in the desert with a machete and she would come back with a rattlesnakes.

305
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,159
And my uncle said that his...

306
00:11:31,159 --> 00:11:37,159
One of his visuals of his mother is like walking up with sandals, skirt, topless,

307
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:40,159
bedded snake and bloody machete.

308
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,159
And a smile.

309
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:42,159
And a smile.

310
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,159
And a spinner.

311
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:44,159
You have loads of hair.

312
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,159
Yeah.

313
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,159
Absolutely.

314
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,159
Is that amazing?

315
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,159
Yeah.

316
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,159
Because you're...

317
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,159
Now you're...

318
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:51,159
You had snake.

319
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,159
I have had snake.

320
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,159
It doesn't taste like chicken.

321
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,159
No.

322
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:56,159
They only say everything tastes like chicken, but it doesn't.

323
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,159
Survival food doesn't taste like chicken.

324
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,159
No, I had...

325
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,159
I had chicken one time at taste like cat.

326
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:03,159
It was pretty sure that it was cat.

327
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,159
From the end.

328
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,159
Yeah.

329
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,159
Maybe a taste like cat.

330
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,159
I was like cat.

331
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,159
I was like cat.

332
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:09,159
Yeah.

333
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,159
I was like...

334
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,159
I was like...

335
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,159
That's not a chicken leg.

336
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,159
That's not the biggest chicken leg up there.

337
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:16,159
That's chicken head of poor.

338
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,159
Yeah, exactly.

339
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:20,159
Stars in lovely gowns, all dressed up.

340
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,159
That's your...

341
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:22,159
That's where you...

342
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,159
That's your home.

343
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,159
Yes.

344
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,159
Because now the ostrich...

345
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:26,159
You're doing the red carpet this year.

346
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,159
I did the red carpet this year, and it was...

347
00:12:29,159 --> 00:12:30,159
You aren't there.

348
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:31,159
You've been working.

349
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,159
Busy.

350
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:33,159
Yes.

351
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:34,159
Hi.

352
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,159
Who are you wearing?

353
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,159
Or who the fuck are you?

354
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,159
I don't have a hair...

355
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
Oh, no.

356
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,159
Next to you.

357
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,159
What's this?

358
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,159
Air Forward business.

359
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:43,159
This is called...

360
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,159
Anybody can say this?

361
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,159
Oh, you can say that in English television.

362
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:47,159
English television.

363
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,159
I wish that.

364
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:49,159
Yeah.

365
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:50,159
I wish I could go for it.

366
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,159
No.

367
00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:52,159
Oh, see.

368
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:53,159
Oh, God.

369
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,159
It feels wrong to me.

370
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:55,159
Really?

371
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:56,159
What can't you say here?

372
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,159
F***.

373
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,159
That's cool.

374
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,159
So don't say it, okay.

375
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,159
The thing is, I see you on the red carpet,

376
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,159
and you see fearless.

377
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,159
But I look to your website, and there you actually go into

378
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,159
the things you'd like to ask people,

379
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,159
but you don't have the nerve.

380
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,159
Well, there are certain rules that you just don't ask people

381
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,159
certain things to their face.

382
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:32,159
Okay.

383
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:35,159
So some of the stars, you have Britney.

384
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,159
What would you like to ask Britney?

385
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,159
Well, I would love to say, why not the eyebrows also?

386
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,159
I'm going for a bitch, do it.

387
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,159
And then, of course, at Katie and Tom.

388
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,159
Now, what would you say to Katie?

389
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,159
What would you say to Katie?

390
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,159
Looks like it popped out of a can.

391
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,159
I shouldn't say it.

392
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:55,159
What would you say to Katie?

393
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:56,159
What would you say to Katie?

394
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:57,159
I shouldn't say it.

395
00:13:57,159 --> 00:13:58,159
What would you say to Katie?

396
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,159
Katie, what would you say to Katie?

397
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,159
The whole thing about the baby, he's there for the birth.

398
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:05,159
And I said, what's he there for the conception?

399
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,159
I'm at the birth.

400
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,159
I was.

401
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,159
I was.

402
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:17,159
It was fun.

403
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,159
No, I remember when she was pregnant, the New York Post

404
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:23,159
and the big headdine said, mission impossible.

405
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:26,159
And finally, at Pinnitabay cruise, what would you be asking

406
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:27,159
Pinnitabay cruise?

407
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:28,159
You love her.

408
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:29,159
All the men love her, yeah.

409
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,159
You do, I think, don't they?

410
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:31,159
It's kind of a mesh outfit, too.

411
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:32,159
It looks like it kind of just goes into one.

412
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,159
I'm just looking for the nipples.

413
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,159
You work now.

414
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:40,159
Look at the nipples now.

415
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,159
A job well done.

416
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,159
If you want to see mine, you want to see mine,

417
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,159
nipples, look at my toes.

418
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,159
Oh, my goodness.

419
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:56,159
I'd actually love to see your nipples.

420
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,159
I know you would.

421
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:03,159
She's so beautiful, but I would love to say to her,

422
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:04,159
do you understand yourself?

423
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:07,159
I don't know what she's talking about.

424
00:15:07,159 --> 00:15:10,159
But she's kind of cute.

425
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,159
Oh, she's got, she was the prettiest at the, at the Oscars.

426
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:15,159
You think she was the prettiest?

427
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,159
Oh, there was no question about it.

428
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,159
Who was the worst dress?

429
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:20,159
Oh, two, Nicole Kidman.

430
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,159
We had long red dress with that white face.

431
00:15:23,159 --> 00:15:25,159
She looked like a ketchup bottle.

432
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,159
Oh, my goodness.

433
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,159
Which end is up, I guess, that's the best.

434
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:37,159
She and I, oh, and I love her so, Meryl Streep.

435
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,159
Oh, when you're on a ride or another stone that dress,

436
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:44,159
it was Jess.

437
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,159
She looks like a Chinese lesbian.

438
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:50,159
She just...

439
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,159
Why, why was she wearing that outfit?

440
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:55,159
I guess you get to the point where you go, why not?

441
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,159
I mean, how many times has she been?

442
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,159
I guess if you're not going to win, you're new, Helen.

443
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:02,159
And it's the 30th time there, and you're kind of feeling a little different.

444
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,159
And, you know, what kind of necklace looks quite heavy though, that.

445
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,159
It looks like one of those pensioner alarm things.

446
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,159
Doesn't it, you know?

447
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,159
Meryl knows health was on its way.

448
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,159
Full, half a down the red carpet.

449
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:16,159
Yes, it looks heavy, doesn't it?

450
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:19,159
I fall, I can't get out.
