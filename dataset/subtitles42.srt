1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
This one's from everyone's favorite Alan Fang.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I don't know him.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Why do ginses smell so bad?

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Why?

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Yeah, look at your bow.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I bow.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
How are you?

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am good.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You're good? I'm great.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have to invest each other.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You're the last girl of the group.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The final boss.

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That doesn't count, does it?

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bowser.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We haven't started yet.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Is it the green one?

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
No, it's fine.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Okay.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
All right.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Um, oh, okay.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wait, do you do one, two, three, or scissors paper rock?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Should we do rock purposes?

24
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
No, scissors paper rock.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Should we do it for him?

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, three rock.

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Rock paper scissors.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Rock paper scissors.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Boom!

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Sounds so weird.

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I don't like it.

32
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Okay.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I like to tell dad jokes.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No shit.

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I do, I like to tell dad jokes.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Um, he laughs at everything I say.

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did I?

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
When?

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did I laugh?

41
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, yeah.

43
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh.

44
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hello.

45
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Already spilling it.

46
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Thank you.

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, you're a jossess for staff.

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Nah, foxes.

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, all right.

50
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I got a long jug for you.

51
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I got a long jug for you, because you seem to like those.

66
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I do.

67
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Uh, three guys are at a ski lodge.

68
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Uh, uh, and they didn't have enough room at the hotel.

69
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So they all had to share a bed.

70
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Uh, and uh, in the morning, uh, the guy who was sleeping on the left side says,

71
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I had the- I had the craziest dream.

72
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Uh, I got a- I got a hand job from a guy.

73
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And then the guy on the right side of the bed said,

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
That's crazy.

75
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I had the same dream.

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
And then the guy in the middle said,

77
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That's weird.

78
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I had a dream.

79
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I was skiing.

80
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,439
I see it was jacking him.

81
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,439
Yeah, sick.

82
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:18,439
Ooh.

83
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:19,439
That's good.

84
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,439
I like it.

85
00:02:20,439 --> 00:02:21,439
Yeah, that's good.

86
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:22,439
That's pretty funny.

87
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:25,840
Do you have to call them my dad is dead jerks?

88
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,840
Oh, he's dead boy.

89
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,840
He's dead.

90
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,840
No more, though.

91
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,840
Just checking.

92
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,840
What, what, what?

93
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
What?

94
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,840
Would you have to call them what?

95
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,319
My dad is dead jerks instead of dad jerks.

96
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,959
Deceased dad jerks.

97
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,759
Yeah, thanks for the punch out.

98
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,759
Oh, yeah, yeah.

99
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,759
Is that the joke?

100
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:50,759
That was the joke.

101
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:51,759
That was the mean.

102
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,759
I can do another one.

103
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,759
It was mean.

104
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:54,759
I want to do any mean ones.

105
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:55,759
I want to do any mean ones.

106
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,759
I had another mean one.

107
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,759
This dad died in the sea.

108
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,759
Do you want to do the other mean ones?

109
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:00,759
No, no, no.

110
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,759
Keep it, keep it for the next one, right?

111
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:03,759
OK.

112
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,759
Why did the mafia cross the road?

113
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:06,759
Why?

114
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:07,759
Forget about it.

115
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:09,759
Oh, it's so racist.

116
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,759
Spaghetti.

117
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,479
I'm trying to get it.

118
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,479
No.

119
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,479
I'm going to get it.

120
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,479
I'm going to get it.

121
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
Fuck.

122
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:19,479
Oh.

123
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
All right.

124
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,479
OK.

125
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,479
I want to win this.

126
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,479
I really want to win.

127
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,479
You're doing badly then.

128
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,479
I know, I know.

129
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,479
You should make me laugh.

131
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
OK.

132
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:35,719
How do you tell the difference between a pure bread cat

133
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,519
and an in bread cat?

134
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,760
One cat has two slices of bread on the inside of it.

135
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,920
That's the criteria.

136
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
It's a real bread.

137
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Why does Dr. Pepper come in a bottle?

138
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Why?

139
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Because his wife died.

142
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Do you come in a bottle too?

143
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,920
No, I use socks.

145
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
I've got one for you then.

146
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:11,319
Did you hear about the erectile dysfunction?

147
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,319
Sorry.

148
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,319
Seminole?

149
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,319
No.

150
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,319
It was a flop.

151
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:18,319
No one came.

152
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,319
I was there.

154
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,319
You see only one.

155
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:25,319
All right.

156
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,120
Why did the pirate get cancelled?

157
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Why?

158
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
Because he used the hot R.

159
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Nice.

161
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
Yeah.

162
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
What's the love?

163
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
No.

164
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
No, no, no, no, no, no.

165
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
No, I'm dead inside.

166
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
This is going to be real.

167
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Yeah.

168
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,120
All right.

169
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
I told you.

170
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Oh.

171
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,120
It's just like an awkward tick.

172
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
All right.

174
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,120
I put it on the top.

175
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,120
A awkward tick.

176
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,120
All right, go on.

177
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,120
What's the difference between you and a calendar?

178
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,120
What?

179
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,120
A calendar has dates.

180
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,120
A calendar has dates.

181
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,120
The gloves are off.

182
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,120
I promised there's no more men once.

183
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Don't cry.

184
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,120
What, what do you call an Asian dwarf?

185
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,120
Just a small person.

186
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Tiny.

187
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
I don't know if I fully get that.

188
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Tiny.

189
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Tiny.

190
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
What's the word meant to...

191
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,120
TIE.

192
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
Tiny

193
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,399
Dwarf eyes not Asian eyes dwarf eyes are like

194
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,399
A

195
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,399
Good

196
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,919
Is it my turn? No, it's my turn. Okay, this will be shit

197
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,639
Some of a laugh

198
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:20,919
What just snakes call it when they do 69 what 11?

199
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,120
That's pretty good. That's pretty good

200
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:27,399
I think it's pretty good. That's pretty good. Thank you

201
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,319
Why don't they teach drivers ed and sex education on the same day in the Middle East?

202
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,239
Why? Because it wears out the camel

203
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,199
Because of the hums

204
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,079
Grinding how do I make you laugh? What do you like?

205
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:49,799
Can I know funny jokes?

206
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Fair enough

207
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:01,000
I got on a real tear for 69 jokes, so I like this naquel. That was it's good right? What does 69 plus 69 equal?

208
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,400
Stinna for four but you laughed like I'm so bad at maths. I was actually trying to do that

209
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,239
It's a hundred and 38. All right. It was a joke ever you didn't have to actually do the calculation

210
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,399
He was struggling. I was trying to help

211
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,599
I can do basic math

212
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:32,279
I'll have you know I can act to double digit numbers at the care of it

213
00:07:32,799 --> 00:07:36,120
How do New Zealanders find sheep in tall grass?

214
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,039
How irresistible

215
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:48,240
That's actually exactly what I like all right good stuff. Oh sheep fucking jokes. That's that's how you get us

216
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,120
What do you call a bug that lets you fuck its wife a

217
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,280
Cockaroch

218
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,879
That's good that's good

219
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,879
Hey bug can I fuck your wife?

220
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,719
What do you call a party with a hundred dwarves? What a little get together

221
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:42,440
I like it. I heard about a tattoo place that was giving out free tattoos to women who would flash their boobs. Is that why you have all your tattoos? Yeah, it was that tattoo for tattoo special

222
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,440
That's that's good. Thanks. So how many free tattoos did you get?

223
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,640
202018 it's 20 different

224
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,040
I'd love to have extra nipples

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,440
Quit gìing, you're ready

226
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,440
That's an old joke, eh?

227
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
No, we'll see you then.

228
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
That's gonna be like a whole hour on that being a pro, but...

229
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Like a prison name.

230
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Jokes about being a pro.

231
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Anyway.

232
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,440
What's the difference between white owls and black owls?

233
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,440
White owls go,

234
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
whoo-toot! And black owls go,

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
what up dog?

236
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,440
That can be a man really, that's good.

237
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,440
Do you know why I like jokes about cats?

238
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Why?

239
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Because I love kitten around.

240
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,440
That's for you.

241
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,440
Okay, this is, I like this one.

242
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
How do you stop a dog from hump in your leg?

243
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,440
Piss on your own leg.

244
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,440
No.

245
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,440
You pick it up and suck its c-

246
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Hey, nice.

247
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,440
I'm a dog of a god that's gonna come in handy.

248
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Oh yeah.

249
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Oh, you've already got a pod, okay?

250
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,440
I thought that one was good.

251
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I clearly.

252
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Okay, so I'm going to the couch for jokes.

253
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,440
I haven't seen any of these, but the gang sent me some jokes.

254
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
All right.

255
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
I'm gonna read them one at a time.

256
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Okay.

257
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
This one's from everyone's favorite Alan Fang.

258
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
I don't know him.

259
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
Why do genders smell so bad?

260
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Why?

261
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
So blind people know who to avoid as well.

262
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Still not a ginger.

263
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Look pretty ginger to me.

264
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
All right, what about this one?

265
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Why do they call genders in China?

266
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
Hey, what about my turn?

267
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Nush.

268
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Drink.

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,440
What do they call genders in China?

270
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
What?

271
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Gross f-

272
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
That's really funny.

273
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,440
Yeah.

274
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,440
Yeah.

275
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,440
Should I do this?

276
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
Yeah, do the accent.

277
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
No, I'm not doing the accent.

278
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm just choosing not to do the accent.

279
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
That was great.

280
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,440
We can cut some of those shitty ones out anyway.

281
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Don't order clothes.

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Don't touch it, bro.

283
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
Oh my god.

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Who's reaching for something else as well?

285
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,440
No, it wasn't.

286
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
I was reaching for something else.

287
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,440
This one's from a killer.

288
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,440
I'm a f-cking loser.

289
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
No, it's not as well.

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
This is a killer.

291
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
Knock, knock.

292
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
Boo.

293
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
You don't have to cry.

294
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
It's only a joke.

295
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,440
You have really nice eyes.

296
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
You're gonna get out of here.

297
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Yeah, let's go.

298
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
That was so shit.

299
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
Um.

300
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I've got one for you.

301
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
Do you know what makes cats great bosses?

302
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
What?

303
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,440
They have excellent leadership.

304
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
You ask for dad jokes and then I say dad jokes.

305
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
And you just...

306
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,440
This is yeah, man.

307
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
We want racism, homophobia, and sexism.

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,440
That's how I'd be like it.

309
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,440
I just...

310
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,440
What's the difference between menstrual blood and sawdust?

311
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh, one's like...

312
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,440
...find getting your mouth.

313
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
You can't gargle sawdust.

314
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Yeah.

315
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
I see where these are going.

316
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Oh.

317
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
Do you like moon cups?

318
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Andrew?

319
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Catches it all in there.

320
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
That's fucked.

321
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
Alright, this is from Abby.

322
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Hi.

323
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,440
Do you hear that Viagra is a treatment for some then?

324
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,440
No.

325
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,440
It doesn't cure it, but it does keep the sheet out of your legs.

326
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
What's your legs?

327
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
I don't know.

328
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,440
You don't get that.

329
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
Sorry.

330
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You said out of your legs.

331
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,440
I'm just a timing pass.

332
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm trying to include everyone.

334
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,440
I got one more to end it.

335
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
It's still going to get two million views.

336
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,440
Not for the comedy.

337
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
When is an elf not an elf?

338
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
When.

339
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
When he's sucking on your c***, then he's a goblin.

340
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,440
We're talking about a goblin.

341
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
What's your name?

342
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
I'm Andy.

343
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Hello.

344
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I'm Andy.

345
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Welcome to my screen call.

346
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Fantastic.

347
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,440
That's fantastic.

348
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
That's great.
