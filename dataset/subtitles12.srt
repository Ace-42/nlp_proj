1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
You had the tooth knocked out this time.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,500
I had a concussion, whiplash, stitches in my hand,

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
dislocated shoulder.

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,000
Yeah, there's been a lot of breaks and sprains and concussions.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I think the most psychologically damaging

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
was when I broke my penis a few years ago.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I was trying to backflip a motorcycle

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
and I can't ride a motorcycle.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And I came off the ramp.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I let go of the bike.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It goes 20 feet in the air.

13
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It comes down and breaks its handlebars off in my crotch.

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So, yeah.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You know, straight to the hospital in surgery.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
But that was like over three years ago

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
and I still have to catheter twice a day.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Like a 15 inch tube,

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
about the size of a number two pencil twice a day.

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Wait a second.

21
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
A 15 inch tube?

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Lucky wife.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
That's not true.

25
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I got to be honest.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
A two inch tube would probably get the job done.

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So, it still isn't healed.

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Not completely.

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
But I have a 10 month old son.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So, it still works.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, yeah.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Yeah.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Thank you.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Thank you for coming.

35
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Thank you.

36
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Well, listen, I was a...

37
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I was a...

38
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The mashed up penis is a very impressive injury.

39
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
About 600 people in our audience tonight.

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, let's see.

41
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Let's see if we can do better than that.

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We'll see who's hurt what?

43
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I don't hurt feelings right there.

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But...

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Have you heard anything? Have you broken anything?

46
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

47
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Never.

48
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Horse riding, anything?

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No, no, no.

50
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bungie gone wrong.

51
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Nothing.

52
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Nothing.

53
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Nothing.

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Nothing at all.

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Can't help you, Johnny.

56
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, you broke something.

57
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Maybe I've broken something.

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What were you up to?

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I broke my nose. I've walked into a tree.

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I've broken a hole.

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A tree?

62
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I walked into a tree.

63
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sensing drink was involved.

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Is it a good thing?

65
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Actually, it was my first week in high school.

66
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I was on school camp.

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
It was an introduction to our new peers and new life at high school.

68
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I was blindfolded and it was a trust game.

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I...

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I like the people you went to school with.

71
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That's a really fun again. Trust me.

72
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Boof.

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Anyone else that anyone broken anything?

74
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, you...

75
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Yeah, I did.

76
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I had an injury.

77
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I got a rubber stuck on my nose.

78
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
LAUGHTER

79
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, it's...

80
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No, it's...

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No, it's not.

82
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
LAUGHTER

83
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
OK.

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
LAUGHTER

85
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
LAUGHTER

86
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And it raised up.

87
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I heard something else.

88
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah.

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That would have been a really good injury.

90
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
LAUGHTER

91
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The...

92
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How that happened bit of the story would have been...

93
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was his first time.

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Did you do it yourself?

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My brother dared me to put a pencil up my nose.

96
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And you know the yellow one to the pink one.

97
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yes, do you know that?

98
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yes.

99
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

100
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I told me I couldn't take it out because it would have raised my memories.

101
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
LAUGHTER

102
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh, wow.

103
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
LAUGHTER

104
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, wow.

105
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
LAUGHTER

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, wow.

107
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
LAUGHTER

108
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, wow.

109
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
LAUGHTER

110
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, wow.

111
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, wow.

112
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How old were you?

113
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Six.

114
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, no permanent damage.

115
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It depends on what you call permanent damage.

116
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Well, I'm proud of all the injured people.

117
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Very good.

118
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yes, sir.

119
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is it really one of the things that attracted you to Aussie

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
was that he doesn't lie?

121
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, it doesn't.

122
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It can't lie.

123
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
And it's like we'd be at business meetings and I would, you know...

124
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Lie.

125
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lie.

126
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, I just embellish things, make them sound better than they actually are.

127
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And he'd be...

128
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Why are you saying that?

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And then I'd be kicking him under the table.

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Stop kicking me under the table.

131
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
LAUGHTER

132
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
And I've got my hair in his foot.

133
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's the matter with you?

134
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I don't like...

135
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, f...

136
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But you'd like to hear him, haven't you?

137
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, loads, God.

138
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

139
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

140
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yeah.

141
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What was the thing about you rode a motorbike?

142
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, God. That was when we were first together

143
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and I wanted to be kind of like hip and happening.

144
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And I told him that I had a Harley-Davidson

145
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and like I would ride it on a Sunday down to Malibu, you know?

146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
No, you were good with the dogs and the pelagon, you know?

147
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Oh, shit.

148
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What?

149
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I wonder where the pelagony rejects a couple of months ago.

150
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She got...

151
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I thought she was going to be wrapped around and trade with these dogs,

152
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
but she was just trying to carry on

153
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
if she'd done it all her life.

154
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll translate.

155
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
LAUGHTER

156
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, God.

157
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're out of your face.

158
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you talking about?

159
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I do know what you're talking about.

160
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Okay.

161
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Yeah.

162
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Look, you were in a jungle in Junkies with Jack

163
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and you went to Pasagolia.

164
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So you understand me, you know?

165
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.

166
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's the matter with you?

167
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh.

168
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Oh.

169
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Thank you, sir, because you have diversified in your life

170
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
into all these different areas,

171
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
into the film and the business,

172
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and is that because realistically,

173
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
it's kind of harder to make money out of music now?

174
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Yeah, that is, but I mean, just my personal interest

175
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
in the storytelling process,

176
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and I've been working on it for three minutes long,

177
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
so you've been only creating descriptions.

178
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The film projects allowed me to develop cause and effect,

179
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
and identify to be able to make it visible

180
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
to the person's defects.

181
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And where do you stand on this thing?

182
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Because people talk about how, or TV,

183
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
with American Idol and X-Factor,

184
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I've now got a stranglehold on music,

185
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
that number one, every week, seems to have something to do.

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I mean, because of the viewership,

187
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
the viewership is so high, I just did the X-Factor.

188
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I had to go in there with them.

189
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Surely you've done enough.

190
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I was like, no, I'm a performer.

191
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Do it.

192
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Did you get any votes?

193
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm not sure if they voted, but they saw me.

194
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Did you meet the X-Factorians?

195
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah. All right.

196
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So, did you see them before?

197
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I did. I did. It was a Marco,

198
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yovanna, and another girl.

199
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
There she goes.

200
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, no, the X-Factor in Italy.

201
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Someone just stole it in my ear.

202
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah. That's what I call Marco and Giovanni, in thing.

203
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, sorry.

204
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's my...

205
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Did you see how politely though we handled that?

206
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Because we thought you would lost your mind, though.

207
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yeah.

208
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Oh, that's so good.

209
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, it's cool.

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Game between Cuba and Mexico.

211
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, my God.

212
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's my favorite.

213
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's my favorite.

214
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You should have just looked like, don't worry, he's been shot.

215
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Thanks a lot.

216
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I think I might quit, too.

217
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
No, I like to make 50s that's arrived in Europe.

218
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm in Europe.

219
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I don't want to hear you go Italy.

220
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It's a suburb of love.

221
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Your own Paris.

222
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes. No, I do...

223
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How many? How many do you have?

224
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I've got two... two Paris.

225
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And Maluck and Cockatoo and a Triton, Cockatoo.

226
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And then...

227
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You like a Cockatoo, don't you?

228
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes.

229
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Even I.

230
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You're saying I'm sorry.

231
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's even I.

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
We're walking down the corridor.

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
And there was a doormark in you window.

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shall I open it?

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, I shall.

236
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Sorry.

237
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

238
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I am.

239
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am.

240
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're just dotting the eyes, you're crossing the teeth.

241
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're Maluck and...

242
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't say the word now.

243
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The Paris.

244
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yes.

245
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
There's a known...

246
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yes.

247
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And there were rescue birds that we got from a rescue centre.

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We only take on birds that...

249
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
For whom they've already had several owners.

250
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And do you exercise your bird?

251
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes. We do.

252
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, in the wild, Paris, particularly Cockatoo's,

253
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
will forage on the forest floor rather than to fly out.

254
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And so they love to run and forage in the ground.

255
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So we would take them to Richmond Park and put them on harnesses.

256
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And just walk them around.

257
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But the dogs don't want to kill your parents.

258
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The sides of their beaks.

259
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Right.

260
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
These dogs...

261
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
There's some sort of evolutionary sort of light bulb going off somewhere.

262
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And we go, yeah, maybe not.

263
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I've seen the footage of Stephen,

264
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
and that bird's going to get on my head and try to get the wax out of my ear

265
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and get off its face.

266
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You've got some top tips in the gym.

267
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Well, I got inspired.

268
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think most people, you go and waves,

269
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
we're like, this is going to be the time where I'm going to get in that crazy shape.

270
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
And I went to the gym and I was working out.

271
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
And I had chosen a day when all of a sudden, randomly,

272
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Arnold Schwarzenegger walked into the gym that I was doing.

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Oh!

274
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, and he was like, you know, this is when he was the gum.

275
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I knew I was in the right gym, right?

276
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I tried to put some more weights on,

277
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
so I would look more impressive.

278
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
And he knew the gym owner or something,

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and he was taking a tour or something.

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And he approached me, and I don't know if he knew me as an actor

281
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
or just he was like, you know, he's the governor,

282
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
like, hello, citizen.

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He said, what are your goals with your workout?

284
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I was so on the spot, but I retreated to this just very little boy place.

285
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I was like, well, to be honest, Arnold, I...

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
If I could have anything, I'd really like to have...

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Did you ever see the movie Fight Club?

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I really liked the way Brad Pitt's abs looked in Fight Club.

289
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
And he said, without hesitating, he said, that's all diet.

290
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You have to eat a lot of carrots.

291
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
And I didn't know... I was like, okay, of course in my mind.

292
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm like, Arnold Schwarzenegger, he was like, Miss Universe.

293
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm Mr. Universe, not Miss Universe.

294
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What a career.

295
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not even going to know if he was all so Miss Universe.

296
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There's so many steroids, but I...

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
So I ran home and I bought a shit ton of carrots.

298
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was eating them for weeks, but nothing ever happened.

299
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
No. Very nice to see you all.

300
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And we're excited to see all three of you.

301
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But I have to know that Cameron, you were very excited to see Sir David.

302
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I am so excited. I am, yes.

303
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I told the prep says you were making Sir David up in Barrel Sandwich.

304
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But he's the meat in the middle of our sandwich right now.

305
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Leave you to it.

306
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Where is slices of bread?

307
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
She's not French steak, and I'm an old male ovis also.

308
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You're gonna be too gritty.

309
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Because you wouldn't be as well-dissueologist.

310
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I did want to be a sociologist.

311
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That was what I thought I was going to be my entire life.

312
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I wanted to study the...

313
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
That's a teacher, so I've learned a lot from you already.

314
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Things that I picked up on backstage were not going to mention though.

315
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
But I ended up studying the behavior of animals.

316
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It just happened to be human animals.

317
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Really?

318
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Yes, you know, as an actor, that's what I do.

319
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I study human behavior.

320
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
And lots of discovering.

321
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yes, lots of discovering.

322
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Big, big.

323
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I like doing so many more surprises when I watch your show.

324
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Yeah.

325
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You should see the outtake.

326
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I would love it.

327
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You want to be a re-can-arrange of you, yes?

328
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I know.
