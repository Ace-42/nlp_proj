1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Because the last time you guys were on the show together and Anthony and Greg, they did a boxing challenge and in a bit of a shock result, Anthony won.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Isn't it weird?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Isn't it weird that heavyweight champion of the world would beat a biscuit eating comedian?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's not do that.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You should have both his arms tied behind his back.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now, so this time, this time, we've got another challenge.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But the last time, you know those boxing things that you hit the boxing thing.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So that's what we did the last time.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This time, we've gone for one of those fun, fair test of strength machines.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Okay, so if you'd like to bring in the machine, here it is.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Come down now to our test of strength.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, two of you are going to stand for it.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
You're going to have a bit of a face off in front of it.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Okay. Okay, we're taking it seriously.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, no, no, we're taking it seriously.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And it is a strength that I believe technique plays a huge part in.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's all I have.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So, have a look.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh!

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
It's Paula.

21
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's Paula.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Okay.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
And now...

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Maybe I'll be turning up.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
To get us in the mood.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Okay, so, Ken Brown is going to give us a little bit of form before we do this.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You do your face off.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Come on, come on.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Okay, off you go.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Okay, ladies and gentlemen, on the left, they call him the postman.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Because he always delivers.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's the undisputed, heavyweight champion of the world, Anthony Joshua!

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
APPLAUSE

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thank you.

36
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And on the right, they call him...

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How's he looking at?

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They call him the courier.

39
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The courier.

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Because he sometimes delivers.

41
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
LAUGHTER

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Unless he gets stuck in traffic.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes?

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He is Greg.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Man, mountain, David!

46
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
APPLAUSE

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So, here we go.

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Here we go.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Here we go.

50
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So, AJ, you go first.

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I thought that was going to be heavier.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You go first.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I would have...

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Okay.

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay, you go first.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You go first.

58
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Mind the cameras.

59
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Here we go.

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So, golf.

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh!

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, dear.

63
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
LAUGHTER

64
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, dear.

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, thank you.

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're welcome.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're welcome.

68
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You go now.

69
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You go now.

70
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I know my soul.

71
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I should ask for that.

72
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So, you're right.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not training yet.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I just am on the wall.

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, you might miss it as well.

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not.

77
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go.

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Go.

79
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Go.

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Hit the bell.

81
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Go on.

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Go on.

83
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Right here.

84
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The courier.

85
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The courier.

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Oh!

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh!

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Thank you.

89
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thank you.

90
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You want to go?

91
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah.

92
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going.

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm going.

94
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going.

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Good.

96
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Good.

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Grab a hand.

98
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Grab a hand.

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't make it.

100
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Do this before you go this way.

101
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yes.

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Walk this way.

103
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Walk this way.

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

105
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Anthony, why don't you help Judy?

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You help Judy.

107
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I should have been a great person.

108
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to help you again.

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can be open.

110
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yeah.

111
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Okay, here we go.

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Here we go.

113
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please do tonight.

114
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just hand in the hammer to Dame Judy Dent.

115
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Come on.

116
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Judy Dent for the bell.

117
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Judy Dent for the bell.

118
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Judy Dent for the bell.

119
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Very heavy.

120
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm going to stand.

121
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to stand.

122
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm going to stand very close.

123
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll leave.

124
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'd say you're about to put it there.

125
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah.

126
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Right there.

127
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Okay, here we go.

128
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Here we go.

129
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are we ready?

130
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Sorry.

131
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes.

132
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh!

133
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Beautiful.

134
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm going to go.

135
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey.

136
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hi, way to go.

137
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can handle this.

138
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank god you are really amazing!

139
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Welcome.

140
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That was funny.

141
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Thank you!

142
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Fifty-chぃgebz darker.

143
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Actually this is a darker, it's more romantic I would say.

144
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yeah, I think that was probably true, yeah.

145
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Yes, but there's probably more sex in it.

146
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Which...

147
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
More sex?

148
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yes, Jamie doesn't speak.

149
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, I make noises.

150
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I make noises.

151
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I make like...

152
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I make like...

153
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
American accent that noises, though.

154
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Um, no, there's...

155
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You know, there's actually a question, though.

156
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Do they let you do that? I mean, like, when you're...

157
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
When you're doing the scenes, does the directors say...

158
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
More vocalization?

159
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I mean, there's often...

160
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
There's often...

161
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
There's often...

162
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
There's often...

163
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That's not... That's not good.

164
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No one comes like that.

165
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
LAUGHTER

166
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's all I do.

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Where do you...

168
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, that way, dude.

169
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
There's some scenes where...

170
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
They will play music, maybe, a bit of...

171
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
If it's a wide shot and it's not like...

172
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So...

173
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's a closest we get to sort of kind of...

174
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Sort of just sort of going forward in one piece.

175
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And they'll play music or something.

176
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
And my temptation is always just to try to make the cutalafs.

177
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So sometimes, I'll do things like when there's a moment where I'm meant to, you know,

178
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
orgasm, I'll be like,

179
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Doy-dy-dy-dy-dy!

180
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
People do that.

181
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Wait.

182
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'll tell you what.

183
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
If they don't, they should.

184
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It's not a Ryanair flight when a Ryanair flight lands.

185
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
IsAlexa-idle-do-do-do-do-do?

186
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know.

187
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh, well.

188
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Cool.

189
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, I thought.

190
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
I still say it backwards.

191
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,199
Did we got a prejudice? Yes.

192
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:01,959
You want to hear it? If you can.

193
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,959
If I can. What do you mean if I can?

194
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:06,360
Tens of married hoppins, skippon.

195
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,560
Oh, Doshas Ali, ex-veer stick, fragile Kelly Rupus.

196
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,759
Oh!

197
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,160
Oh, yeah.

198
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,360
You know, I agree.

199
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,720
I agree.

200
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
LAUGHTER

201
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,959
Just doing that. What's that?

202
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,079
I've never... I'm pretty thick, but I've never understood

203
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:26,759
the thing that Morgan Freeman said to you that...

204
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,759
Oh, so when I was...

205
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,759
This was about 10 years ago.

206
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,919
I did a film with Morgan Freeman.

207
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:34,039
It was a really small film.

208
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:37,479
And the first 10 pages or 10 minutes of the film

209
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,240
are us two just driving together in a car and talking.

210
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,639
And it took three days to shoot.

211
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,159
And he didn't talk to me the entire time.

212
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,839
Like, in between takes, right?

213
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:51,000
Because he had so much dialogue I learned later, right?

214
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,039
Okay. So he was just...

215
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,960
You know, so in between we wouldn't really chat.

216
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,120
But we were in the car together for three days.

217
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,080
And then, at the end of the third day,

218
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,840
he just turns to me and he goes,

219
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,920
Jonah, Jonah, Bobona, Bonana, Fena, Fafona,

220
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,200
Mima, Momona, Jonah.

221
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,200
LAUGHTER

222
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
That's it.

223
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,840
And then it was like super uncomfortable.

224
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
I didn't know what to say.

225
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,879
It was one of more weird moments of my life.

226
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,960
And I just didn't know what to say.

227
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,480
So I just said, thank you.

228
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,480
LAUGHTER

229
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,200
And then he said, it was quiet again, and he said, do me.

230
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
LAUGHTER

231
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,879
And what? It was like, do my name.

232
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:35,720
And I was like, do your name?

233
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,240
And he's like, yeah, do my name.

234
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,360
And I was like, Morgan Morgan, Boborgan,

235
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
and Boborgan.

236
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,520
Me, Mima, Morgan.

237
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,920
Morgan.

238
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,040
He went, all right.

239
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
And then we never spoke again.

240
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,040
LAUGHTER

241
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,840
The only thing that links our got just everyone started very young.

242
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,600
Now, the last time we were here, we enjoyed very much

243
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,400
your early work on the voyage of the Mimi.

244
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:01,879
Yes.

245
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:03,000
We're not going to show any more.

246
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,480
Thank you.

247
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
Do the blitz, because it is worth seeing.

248
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,000
LAUGHTER

249
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,280
Look at that slide.

250
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,280
No, what's he got?

251
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,280
What's he got, could he?

252
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,480
That is very good listening bass.

253
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Very good interested listening bass.

254
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,280
Yeah.

255
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,480
Tell me more.

256
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
That is.

257
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:21,639
LAUGHTER

258
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,639
No, seriously, you really need to Google it.

259
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,840
And seeing it, you started, was it modeling you started?

260
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,439
You were quite young when you started modeling.

261
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,279
I was a sure, and so, like, no, I mean, yes, but not like proper.

262
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,919
No, not like that, either.

263
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,919
No, I just see.

264
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,919
What in proper modeling?

265
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,440
Yeah, just draw a veil.

266
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,720
I did a bit, yeah.

267
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,919
And then Emma, you did some extraordinary work as a child actor.

268
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,320
I mean, take this, Merrill Streep.

269
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,519
Oh, look at that.

270
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,439
What is that?

271
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,480
What is that?

272
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
What is that?

273
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
It's a prosthetic.

274
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
No.

275
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
That's amazing.

276
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
That's a prosthetic.

277
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I did a kind of Egor G. Robinson thing where I was like,

278
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
oh, where?

279
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
It kind of was Merrill, jeez.

280
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
It's genius.

281
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,480
It's genius.

282
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,480
But tonight, with La La Land in mind, we are going to focus on the early dancing career

283
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
of Mr. Ryan Costing.

284
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Oh, well.

285
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Oh, yeah.

286
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Let me see.

287
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
It makes sense.

288
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
We've got only video you have tonight is.

289
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
Yeah, there's this.

290
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,480
So the dance troupe you were in, can you tell us about it?

291
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,759
Apparently, young dancers, they could be quite vicious.

292
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,759
It's a cutthroat business.

293
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,960
I had to get out.

294
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:41,320
I was on some kind of Canadian star search, and I somehow made it to the finals.

295
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:47,279
And my main competition were these two twins who were tap dancers, and they were dancing

296
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,279
to Phil Collins' two hearts.

297
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,279
Oh.

298
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:55,039
And they had big heart-shaped bows, and they were the ones to beat.

299
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:01,759
So I remember wishing them luck and going on stage, and I was getting ready to start.

300
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,079
I was dancing to everybody dance now by CNC Music Factor, of course.

301
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,120
And I'm getting ready to start, which is this is how you started.

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,120
A winning dance number, if you want to know.

303
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,919
You're getting out of your hands, but you know how I go up.

304
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:20,360
And I look up into the just off stage, and the two twins are standing there.

305
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,919
They're like the twins from the shiny.

306
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:24,919
And they're just going like this.

307
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:35,919
And I was like, I was like, all right.

308
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,919
This means more.

309
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:37,919
Why?

310
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,919
I just shimmyed my way all the way to that trophy, to that tiny little trophy.

311
00:10:42,919 --> 00:10:44,919
Is this the same thing?

312
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,919
I was going to say it's an all-girl troop, but obviously it's not.

313
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,919
You're in it.

314
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:52,919
But you are the only boy in it.

315
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,919
Yeah, that was the...

316
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:55,919
That was the point.

317
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:56,919
That was the gimmick.

318
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:59,919
They let me dance there for free because I was a guy.

319
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,919
Because if you had a guy, you would win.

320
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:03,919
Oh, OK.

321
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,919
So are you ready to see the dance styles?

322
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:15,919
I believe you're dancing to Kathy Dennis' classic Touch Me.

323
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,919
Did the troop have a name, Ryan?

324
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,919
It was Elite Dance Studio.

325
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:22,919
And how old are you in this one?

326
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:25,919
Old enough to know better.

327
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,919
In joy.

328
00:11:38,919 --> 00:12:02,919
I wish I could say someone said, here, you have to wear this.

329
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:04,919
That was my idea.

330
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:07,919
I thought, I have a vision for this number.

331
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:10,919
That's the typical and silver hammer pants.

332
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:12,919
The silver hammer pants are...

333
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:13,919
I don't think we know, Joe.

334
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:14,919
We gave them enough of a shot.

335
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,919
We gave up with Hammer, but I think we should have kept them going.

336
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:19,919
We didn't give them...no.
