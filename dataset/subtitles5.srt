1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
Age sucks if you got a face.

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,080
But is it because America is really so youth obsessed?

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,080
I mean, how?

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,759
And in the film, you show kind of that it is hard for a woman

5
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,599
of your age to get the job.

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,960
It's beyond difficult.

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,839
The only jobs really left now for women

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,039
unless they get friendly with people to do films.

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,480
But the only jobs that are really commercials,

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,039
I just thank God, I made my,

11
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:30,960
usually not this year, on a protocol girly,

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,679
which is for driver-jina.

13
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:34,000
And it's a...

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,479
It may yet?

15
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:40,399
Well, anyone knows the heartbreak of driver-jina.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,159
LAUGHTER

17
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:44,159
I was...

18
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,960
LAUGHTER

19
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,039
I was perfect for it.

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,399
And Cavill's follow me home.

21
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:54,079
LAUGHTER

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,079
LAUGHTER

23
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,039
Three Jewish men are trying to rent my uterus

24
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,960
instead of going to Miami.

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,039
LAUGHTER

26
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:08,039
LAUGHTER

27
00:01:08,039 --> 00:01:10,039
LAUGHTER

28
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:12,039
And there's...

29
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:15,039
Thank God for these commercials.

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:17,039
There's one called...

31
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:20,039
Zestra, is that coming in yet?

32
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,039
LAUGHTER

33
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,039
It's like women's...

34
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,039
Viagra has that happened yet?

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
It's women's Viagra.

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,200
And they have this big discussion with me.

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,719
Should they make it in pill form?

38
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,160
This is honest to God, true.

39
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
There was a lady's favorite.

40
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,160
Pill form or cream?

41
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,680
Because they didn't know which would do better.

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,680
And they find a side of these idiots will do it in cream

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,200
because if it's in pill form, in a bar,

44
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,760
a man can drop it in a woman's drink.

45
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,760
And she won't know it.

46
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,160
But if you're in a bar and a guy goes,

47
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,480
so where you from?

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,480
LAUGHTER

49
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,480
LAUGHTER

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,480
LAUGHTER

51
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,480
Oh!

52
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,480
Another thing.

53
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
I know I'm going to get this alarm a lot.

54
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
Charlize Ferrer.

55
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,480
No, I was just...

56
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,480
I was back there freaking out.

57
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,480
You're like the first person who said it perfectly.

58
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,480
Really?

59
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
Yes. I'll stop now.

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I won't say it again.

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,480
It's amazing.

62
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,480
15 years.

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
And then you came along.

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh, she's just here.

65
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,479
Do you guys know each other outside of being back there

66
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,479
on a sofa?

67
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,479
I know, John.

68
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,479
And I don't know Steve.

69
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:28,479
LAUGHTER

70
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:30,479
John, can I see him on the telly?

71
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:32,479
You know that's not real.

72
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,479
I know.

73
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,479
Now, it is Jubilee weekend.

74
00:02:35,479 --> 00:02:36,479
Do you have plans?

75
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:37,479
Anybody got plans?

76
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:40,479
I didn't realise it was Jubilee weekend.

77
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,479
But when I got here, I got in town a couple days ago

78
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,479
and was invited, I guess, to sit next to the queen

79
00:02:47,479 --> 00:02:49,479
on the boat, going down the...

80
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,479
Oh, you're joking, that's amazing.

81
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,479
Oh, you're joking.

82
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,479
I'm not going to do it.

83
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:56,479
LAUGHTER

84
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,479
I don't know her.

85
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,479
I don't know her.

86
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,479
Four hours.

87
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,479
It's a long thing.

88
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,479
What are we going to talk about?

89
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,479
I don't own crowns or...

90
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:06,479
Or tiaras or...

91
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:07,479
No, I don't know if you're joking or not.

92
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,479
Are you joking?

93
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,479
Oh, no, I'm completely joking.

94
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,479
Oh, no.

95
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,479
Nothing...

96
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,479
He has been invited on the boat.

97
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,479
I'm really confused now.

98
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,479
Are you being invited on the boat?

99
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,479
No.

100
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:20,479
Well...

101
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,479
No.

102
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,479
Did you like him as well?

103
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:24,479
Nice of me as well.

104
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,479
That's fun.

105
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:27,479
It's a big story.

106
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:30,479
I didn't even know there was going to be a boat.

107
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:33,479
And...

108
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,479
And these two were thinking...

109
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:35,479
No!

110
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:37,479
Do they know we have an Oscar?

111
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,479
Do they not know?

112
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:44,479
It's just another thing you don't have in common with the Queen.

113
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:48,479
Now, Charlie's there.

114
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:51,479
Now we're delighted you're here for all sorts of reasons.

115
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:53,479
I'm so happy to be here. I'm a huge fan.

116
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,479
Thank you.

117
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,479
That's the end of episode one.

118
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,479
The Doctor's thing.

119
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,479
Yeah.

120
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,479
Did that really happen?

121
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,479
Yeah.

122
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,479
My mum will kill me for telling this because it was my...

123
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:14,479
Our family doctors.

124
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,479
And I...

125
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,480
He'd been...

126
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Our family...

127
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
My doctor since I was a child.

128
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
And I went to...

129
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
As an adult.

130
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Because...

131
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,480
I was...

132
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,480
There was something wrong with my...

133
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,480
Bum.

134
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
When you said,

135
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,480
Bum, you looked at me directly in the eyes.

136
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I'm sorry.

137
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
I'm sorry.

138
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
I mean, Emma Rouse,

139
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Dunn, Unnerved and E.com.

140
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,480
I think.

141
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,480
There was something...

142
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,480
Do you count?

143
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,480
But there was something wrong with my...

144
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Bum.

145
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,480
LAUGHTER

146
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,480
I was really imagining.

147
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
Yeah.

148
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
And I was...

149
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,480
I said,

150
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,480
There's this thing wrong with my Bum and he went,

151
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
OK.

152
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,480
And I went,

153
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
So...

154
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,480
What did he say?

155
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,480
He goes,

156
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:56,480
Well,

157
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,480
It'll probably be all right.

158
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
And I said,

159
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,480
Well, I...

160
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,480
I was really lucky.

161
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
I'd like you to just...

162
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,480
If you could make me feel better about...

163
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,480
If I feel better,

164
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
then it will be all right.

165
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,480
And he went,

166
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,480
It'll probably clear itself up.

167
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
And I said,

168
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Yeah, but...

169
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
It's your only way I could be sure...

170
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
And he went,

171
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,480
Oh...

172
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
You want me to put my finger up there, don't you?

173
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
LAUGHTER

174
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
No.

175
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,480
Not if it's not magically necessary.

176
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
LAUGHTER

177
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
And the other...

178
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,480
I think...

179
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,480
Maybe there's a reason,

180
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
But what is the reason that you film it

181
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,480
in the school you used to teach?

182
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,480
I think it's therapy, probably.

183
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,480
I mean, natural classroom where I taught,

184
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,480
Because I was just to keep the theme going,

185
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,480
A real teacher for a long time.

186
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Yeah, I taught for...

187
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Yeah, but six years in the school that we film it,

188
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
In the classroom that I'm going mad in, and...

189
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,480
But that's really...

190
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, that was my classroom, yeah.

191
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
But you did it for such a long time, did you ever enjoy it?

192
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Was there ever a moment when you thought,

193
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,480
I like this?

194
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,480
No.

195
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
OK.

196
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Well, I met some very nice people there.

197
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,480
And you were like,

198
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
You were nominated for Teacher of the Year, weren't you?

199
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Yes, I was great.

200
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
I was.

201
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
Yeah.

202
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,480
Yeah, you know, yes.

203
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
I've told this story many times.

204
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
But Teacher of the Year is a very prestigious award,

205
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
It's taken very seriously, rightly,

206
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
By the hard-working teaching community.

207
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
And my head teacher called me in,

208
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,480
And he was wetting himself laughing.

209
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,480
If I couldn't stop laughing for the first ten minutes,

210
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,480
And he went,

211
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,480
I went, what...

212
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,480
Why have you called me here?

213
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,480
He goes,

214
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
You've been...

215
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,480
You've been nominated.

216
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,480
And I went, oh, OK.

217
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,480
And it was by a very sweet girl called Gemma,

218
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,480
I've humiliated many times.

219
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,480
And it's a six-page document that people have to fill in

220
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
For the reasons why you should be nominated for Teacher of the Year.

221
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,480
It was blank,

222
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,480
Aside from one sentence that she'd written on it,

223
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Which was of the reasons why she'd written on it.

224
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,480
She was like,

225
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
I'm telling you,

226
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
I'm not going to write it down.

227
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
It's a book that I've written.

228
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I'm not going to write it down.

229
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
It's a book that I've written on.

230
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I'm not going to write it down.

231
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
I'm not going to write it down.

232
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
I'm not going to write it down.

233
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
She'd written on it,

234
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Which was of the reasons why you think he should be teacher of the year.

235
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
And she'd written,

236
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
He's a well-good laugh,

237
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
And he don't make us do no work.

238
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,480
LAUGHTER

239
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:12,480
Why have you seen more of you two together?

240
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,480
It's a pairing.

241
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,480
It really is.

242
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,480
It's a match made in heaven.

243
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Oh, my God.

244
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,480
Now, Jack and Chan.

245
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Yes.

246
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Jack and Chan.

247
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Yeah.

248
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,480
Right.

249
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I haven't done that once.

250
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I'm very stupid.

251
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
I haven't seen it in my hands.

252
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,480
I'm going,

253
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Jackie Chan.

254
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm not doing it.

255
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Because is it true that everyone just goes,

256
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Jackie Chan?

257
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
Yeah.

258
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I really hate that.

259
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I'm trying to do it.

260
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Whenever I go in the Euro in America,

261
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Especially the father-of-the-chews,

262
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Look, Jackie Chan!

263
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Why nobody see Robert De Niro?

264
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,480
Why?

265
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,480
That's a Robert De Niro.

266
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Wow.

267
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Dax King Hoffman, Jackie Chan.

268
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,480
One day, one day, I hope people...

269
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Wow, that's the Jackie Chan.

270
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Yes.

271
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Yes.

272
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
That's Jackie Chan.

273
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
I'm trying.

274
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
I'm trying to Australian myself.

275
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,480
You just come from the Can film festival?

276
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Yeah.

277
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Can film festival.

278
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,480
Do you enjoy things like that?

279
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Are they fun?

280
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Or is it just business?

281
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:20,480
The whole thing about those big events,

282
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,480
the particularly in candles, red carpet things.

283
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Do you enjoy them?

284
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,480
No, I can't do any of that.

285
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,480
I really can't.

286
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,480
I've seen you.

287
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,480
Have you on a red carpet?

288
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,480
I don't think so.

289
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
No.

290
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
Have you?

291
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Have you show up at things?

292
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,480
Not much, to be honest.

293
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
But you've done posh things.

294
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
You've met the Queen, haven't you?

295
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,480
I haven't met the Queen.

296
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes, I haven't met the Queen.

297
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:46,480
I think it was one of those receptions for people in the arts.

298
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
You should have been there, Graham.

299
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
I was.

300
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
You were overlooked.

301
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Yes, I was.

302
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Yes, you were the dirty potty man.

303
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,480
Yeah, I was.

304
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
You know what I was amazed at with the Queen?

305
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
She's very tiny, which is something for me to say,

306
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
because I'm quite short.

307
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
And she moves as if on roller blades.

308
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,480
She just slides up like that.

309
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
Is there no actual walking sky?

310
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,480
I don't know what's going on under there.

311
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
She might be on castors for all the men.

312
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,480
But she comes to where you are, the group where you are.

313
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,480
For a start, you have to, you have to tussle with that whole idea of will you curse?

314
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
You went, will you curse?

315
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
And I decided before, no, look, curtsy.

316
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
It's no.

317
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm not going to bow down before Royal.

318
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'm not going to.

319
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,480
And then immediately you do.

320
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
Immediately you curse.

321
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
You're barging much, too low.

322
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,480
No.

323
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
That's really revolting.

324
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
And then I mean, of me, I mean.

325
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,480
And then, the Queen says a small, there was a group of about four of us around her.

326
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,480
And she says a very small thing, you know.

327
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,480
So are you enjoying the evening?

328
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
And everybody goes like this.

329
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
She's like,

330
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
I'm not.

331
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,480
So the Queen, I think people are just nervous.

332
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,480
Are they eager to please?

333
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Don't want to be beheaded or something.

334
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,480
I'm in the Queen.

335
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
So the Queen, I'm sure, must think that she's a great comedian or something.

336
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,480
That's what she says is people forning and loving and everything.

337
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
She says, I was doing it.

338
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Why was I doing it?

339
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I did it.

340
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
I did it.

341
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,480
You met the Queen.

342
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,480
Yes, I do.

343
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,480
You met Jack Jarrett.

344
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
I was in Hong Kong.

345
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,480
I remember, and long, long time ago, my English is so bad in that time.

346
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
I remember when Queen was here, you used her hand.

347
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,480
Otherwise you were standing here.

348
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

349
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Royal, what?

350
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
You're Royal Highness?

351
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Yes, Royal Highness, yes.

352
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I then have the remember.

353
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,480
You're Royal Highness.

354
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
You're Royal Highness.

355
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,480
Then it's when we're playing around.

356
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Queen's coming, Queen's coming.

357
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Then, what should I say?

358
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Then I see the Queen, the Queen, stop, stop, stop, so quick.

359
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
No, no, no, no, no.

360
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
I said, oh, OK.

361
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Then when she comes, you're already ruined.

362
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I just admit it like you.

363
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
I admit it like that.

364
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,480
She stands still standing there.

365
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
The people are into the Jackie Chan and her.

366
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Oh!

367
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,480
She keep talking to me.

368
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,480
My head is empty.

369
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I don't know what she's talking about.

370
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
You know, honestly, go away.

371
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Go away.

372
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
Leave me alone.

373
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,480
I'm telling you.

374
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Of course, I'm so happy just standing here,

375
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
more than like a three-minute, five-minute,

376
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
but I just don't go away, please.

377
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Don't talk to me anymore.

378
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I don't know how to answer back.

379
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm going to America.

380
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,480
That's right.

381
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
If they're at New Zealand, that's right.

382
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
And they got whisked off.

383
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
They got whisked off on a little...

384
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
Oh, that's good.

385
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,480
That's a hell of a service.

386
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Oh, my God, the glasses, champagne.

387
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
Can we say whisked on BBC One?

388
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I think.

389
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,480
She can't say whisked off.

390
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Oh, that...

391
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,480
You can say piss stuff, though, can you?

392
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Yes.

393
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
Oh, it's all good now.

394
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Yes, yes.

395
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Minutes in. Good night.

396
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Now, did you drive yourself here tonight?

397
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
No.

398
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
No, I've got my driving license.

399
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,480
No, I'm still on driving me.

400
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Would you get in the car with them?

401
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
If so...

402
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Come on, be rough, honey.

403
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
You're coming to black moron.

404
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
No, it depends.

405
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,480
But now my husband is officially allowed to drive.

406
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Yes, I would get in the car with him.

407
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Good.

408
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I know, yeah.

409
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
That was right.

410
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
It's only two sixty-one years.

411
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
But I mean, the children are teaching you.

412
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,480
No, well, before I was too pissed to drive you.

413
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay, fair enough.

414
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
I went out for my test and I'd go,

415
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
let's see him in, I'd go,

416
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,480
no, Mr. Osborne, come back in on the day.

417
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
I'm not even getting in the car with you.

418
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Walking on the test,

419
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,480
I'd be in the bottle of oak,

420
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
and my pocket didn't go any good.

421
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
Did you learn in a manual or an automatic?

422
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
I can drive anything, one of those, a few trees.

423
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,480
That's all I've got.

424
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
There are anything you can use yet.

425
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
No.

426
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,480
I've got a job.

427
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
I think that's the only solution.

428
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Is that anything that can go on BBC One?

429
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Not yet.

430
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,480
You've just had a promotion.

431
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
It's all DVD extras.

432
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I know.

433
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
But it's a proper western.

434
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I mean, we see Tom Hanks gun-token,

435
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
which we already see.

436
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Well, I don't have, I don't wear one.

437
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
I am given one later on,

438
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
so it's not like, you know, I'm not doing the root and toot and kind of,

439
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,480
you know, but I ride a horse,

440
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
and I drive a wagon,

441
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,480
and I've discovered, so I'm not a rider per se,

442
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
but I did learn.

443
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I had a fabulous,

444
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,480
got to know a fabulous whop name,

445
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,480
Wimpy, who was my horse.

446
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,480
Wimpy was my horse.

447
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,480
And I don't know if anybody here has written a lot,

448
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,480
or made a western Emily has a couple of westerns under her belt,

449
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
as I recall.

450
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
Emily, my darling, how are you?

451
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
How are you?

452
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,480
Wonderful to see you.

453
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
It's good to see you.

454
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Emily Glunt.

455
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
Do you know what I'm about to do a western?

456
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Like, next year, I'm doing a six-part western,

457
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,480
and we were just discussing how allergic I am to horses,

458
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,480
and I do every scene with a horse, you know.

459
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,480
I'm going to be anti-histamine, up to my eyeball.

460
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,480
Do you have to kiss the horse?

461
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I do.

462
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
Yes, and that isn't what happens in westerns,

463
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
you make out with your horse.

464
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,480
You develop an affection for those beasts.

465
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,480
You're a champion.

466
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,480
You're kind of wick.

467
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,480
Every morning, you throw your arms around Wimpy,

468
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:56,480
and you say, how are you, my darling, little chestnut?

469
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
I'm so convinced about you.

470
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
Which you sort of have to do, because I have a feeling that horses, honestly,

471
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,480
they would much rather live in a world without human beings climbing on top, though.

472
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
And they know the moment you climb on their back, that you're terrible at riding.

473
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
Like, I mean, I've been learning right now,

474
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
I'm in London now, rehearsing for it,

475
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
and I go riding three times a week,

476
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
and every time they give me a different horse to see, you know, how you fare,

477
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,480
with one that's more sprainy, or one that's less of a Ferrari.

478
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,480
And I got on one of the other day called Rusty.

479
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,480
My god, I almost took off with me, it was terrifying.

480
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,480
I couldn't walk the next day, Rusty did me in.

481
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,480
No, no, no.

482
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Rusty did her in.

483
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
Rusty did me in.

484
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,480
Oh, wow.

485
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Is that the name of the film?

486
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
That's what he is.

487
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Oh, my god.

488
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm a gin now, Sir Patrick Stewart, and you don't really use the Sir much, do you?

489
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Um...

490
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
What should I...

491
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Sorry, should I have been calling you...

492
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
No, I shouldn't. Am I supposed to?

493
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
No.

494
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Okay.

495
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
But do you...

496
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
No, do you...

497
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
I take my lead from Sir Ian,

498
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,480
whom we've both shared some time with.

499
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Yes.

500
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
And he is...

501
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
He is so...

502
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Flegmatic about all of that, and I just...

503
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,480
You know, it's a great honour, but it's not something that I need to press.

504
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,480
When you bump into another Sir when you're out and about.

505
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
Do you then...

506
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
Do you...

507
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
Do you pull the other Sir?

508
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Well, you must roll in Sir circles.

509
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,480
Okay.

510
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
Circles.

511
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Sir, sir.

512
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,480
Sir, sir.

513
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I just...

514
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I just opened it.

515
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
Yeah.

516
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,480
It's minute.

517
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,480
That was alright, man.

518
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
Sir, I heard it.

519
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Can I read the ignorant American in the ass?

520
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
So, how do you become a Sir?

521
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
Um...

522
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
Well, Patrick, how?

523
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
I don't know.

524
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Well, you know, it's a case of...

525
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Oh, no, no, no.

526
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:58,480
I got mine on the Queen's Birthday Honours.

527
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,480
But you have reminded me that I did have a Sir encounter,

528
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
only a few weeks ago in Los Angeles.

529
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
A rather fancy...

530
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,480
In fact, extremely fancy restaurant.

531
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,480
Tell them what it is, they'll know.

532
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
Um, it was the... the... the Tower Bar.

533
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
Uh, something to tell you?

534
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
No.

535
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
No, yeah.

536
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,480
No, yeah.

537
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Guys, that's cool.

538
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
No, no, no, no.

539
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Sit, sit, sit.

540
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Look up the tower.

541
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
The Tower Bar.

542
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Oh, man, it's on you.

543
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Oh, man, it's on you.

544
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
What?

545
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
It's on you.

546
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
It's on you.

547
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
It's on you.

548
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
It's on you.

549
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
It's on you.

550
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Oh, man.

551
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
It's on you.

552
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
It's on you.

553
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
It's on you.

554
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh, go on.

555
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Keep going.

556
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
You keep going.

557
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,480
Keep going.

558
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay.

559
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Well, not a Tower Bar, it is a spot.

560
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I got a feeling this isn't going to work out.

561
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
It's a spot.

562
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
It's quite far away.

563
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,480
Um, so we had four of us were seated at a table,

564
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
about 15 minutes later,

565
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,480
into the restaurant, walks Sir Paul McCartney.

566
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
Wow.

567
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Good.

568
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,480
Now, Paul and I have a very slender relationship,

569
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,480
but it's lasted decades.

570
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
Okay.

571
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I first encountered him in 1964.

572
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
No.

573
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,480
When his girlfriend, Jane Asher,

574
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
then, had told him that I loved Aston Martin's.

575
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,480
I was driving a battered old Ford,

576
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,480
but Aston Martin's were my dream car.

577
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
She told him this.

578
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,480
And one night, we knew he was seeing the show.

579
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,480
There was a knock on my door.

580
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
And I said, yeah, come in.

581
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
I'm there in my underwear.

582
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
As usual.

583
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Well, I always...

584
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
As you break people, I have a round.

585
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,480
I have a round back just in the hope.

586
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
I'm in, I'm in my pants.

587
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Yes.

588
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
I'm ready for you.

589
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
I'm ready for you.

590
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Come in.

591
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
And the door opened, standing there was Paul McCartney,

592
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
who I had never met before.

593
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,480
And this was 1964.

594
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
And he said, Jane says that you like Aston Martin's here.

595
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Drive this.

596
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Wow.

597
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,480
And he tossed a bunch of keys off the window.

598
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
And it was an ass.

599
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
It was easy.

600
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
It was easy.

601
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Anyway, you want to hear the rest of the...

602
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Keep going.

603
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,480
We're in the fanciest restaurant in LA.

604
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
We're now in the Tower Bar.

605
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,480
Tower?

606
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Oh!

607
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
What?

608
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Oh, my God!

609
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
Oh!

610
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Oh!

611
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,480
It's a legend.

612
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,480
I am feeling less, less good now.

613
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,480
Keep going.

614
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
Keep going.

615
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You're in there.

616
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
The Paul McCartney's coming.

617
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
I'm ready for you.

618
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,480
You know him in the 60s.

619
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:40,480
And he sees me and comes over and I stand up and say,

620
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
Hi, and we have a big hug in the restaurant.

621
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,480
And I'm very much aware that there's all the tables

622
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
are full on this kind of thing.

623
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
And we talk for five or six minutes,

624
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
and he goes and sits down.

625
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,480
Five minutes go by, and into the restaurant walks a ringo star.

626
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I swear to you.

627
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm not making this happen.

628
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
What were they together?

629
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
They were...

630
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
Oh, they were at the same table.

631
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Well, they were at the same table.

632
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,480
Well, we were at the Tower of Bartholomew.

633
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I am expecting so many free meals.

634
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:18,480
And we finish early, and I get up to go,

635
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,480
and Paul stands up to say goodbye, and we have a hug.

636
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,480
And this we have a hug.

637
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,480
He says into my ear,

638
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
Do you know a ringo?

639
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I said, yeah, of course.

640
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
I've never met him, but I'm...

641
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Oh, ringo, come on, come over here.

642
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Hang on a minute, he said,

643
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Sir Ringo, Sir Patrick, Sir Paul.

644
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Hey, we've got the Knights of the Round Table.

645
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Oh, you're doing well.

646
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
You got that.

647
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,480
You got that.

648
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
You got that.

649
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Oh, you're doing well.

650
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
You're doing well.

651
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
You're doing well.

652
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
You're doing well.

653
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
You're doing well.
